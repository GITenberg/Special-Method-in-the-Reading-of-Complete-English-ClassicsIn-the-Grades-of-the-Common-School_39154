<h3>EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE</h3>


<p>The gradual introduction of the choicer products
of literature into the grades of the common school
has been going on for several years. Bringing the
school children face to face with the thoughts of the
masters has had often a thrilling effect, and the feeling
has spread among teachers that a new door has
been opened into what Ruskin calls "The King's
Gardens." As we stand at this open portal to the
Elysian Fields of literature, there may fall upon us
something of the beauty, something even of the
solemn stillness, of the arched cathedral with its
golden windows. But how inadequate is the Gothic
cathedral, or the Greek temple, to symbolize the
temple of literature.</p>

<p>Within less than a score of years there has been
such reading of varied literary masterpieces by children
as to bring us face to face with a problem of
prime significance in education, the place and importance
of literature in the education of American
children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Millions of children are introduced yearly to bookland,
and it is a matter of greater importance than
what Congress does, what provision is made for
these oncoming millions in the sunlit fields and
forest glades of literature, where the boys and girls
walk in happy companionship with the "wisest and
wittiest" of our race. We have now had enough
experience with these treasures of culture to get a
real foretaste of the feast prepared for the growing
youth. We know that their appetites are keen and
their digestive powers strong. It is incumbent upon
educators to get a comprehensive survey of this land
and to estimate its resources. Other fields of study,
like natural science, geography, music, etc., are
undergoing the same scrutiny as to their educative
value. Literature, certainly a peer in the hierarchy
of great studies, if not supreme in value above others,
is one of the most difficult to estimate. Tangible
proofs of the vital culture-force of good literature
upon growing minds can be given in many individual
cases. But to what degree it has general or universal
fitness to awaken, strengthen, and refine all
minds, is in dispute.</p>

<p>It seems clear, at least, that only those who show
taste and enthusiasm for a choice piece of literature
can teach it with success. This requirement of appreciation
and enjoyment of the study is more imperative
in literature, because its appeal is not merely
to the intellect and the reason, as in other studies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
but especially to the emotions and higher &aelig;sthetic
judgments, to moral and religious sentiment in ideal
representation.</p>

<p>It has been often observed that discussions of the
superior educative value of literature before bodies
of teachers, while entertaining and delightful, fall far
short of lasting results because of the teachers' narrow
experience with literature. In the case of many
teachers, the primitive alphabet of literary appreciation
is lacking, and the most enthusiastic appeals to
the charm and exaltation of such studies fall harmless.
Yet literature in the schools is hopeless without teachers
who have felt at home in this delightsome land,
this most real world of ideal strength and beauty.</p>

<p>The discussion of the subject for teachers is beset,
therefore, with peculiar and seemingly insurmountable
difficulties. The strength, charm, and refinement
of literature are known only to those who
have read the masters with delight, while even
people of cultured taste listen doubtfully to the
praise of authors they have never read. To one
enamoured of the music of Tennyson's songs, the
very suggestion of "In Memoriam" awakens enthusiasm.
To one who has not read Tennyson and
his like, silence on the subject is golden. To those
not much travelled in the fields of literature, there
is danger of speaking in an unknown tongue, while
they, of all others, need a plain and convincing word.
To speak this plain and convincing word to those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
who may have acquired but little relish for literature,
and that little only in the fragmentary selections of
the school readers, is a high and difficult aim. But
teachers are willing to learn, and to discover new
sources of enthusiasm in their profession. It is
probable, also, that the original capacity to enjoy
great literature is much more common than is often
supposed, and that the great average of teachers is
quite capable of receiving this powerful stimulus.
The fact is, our common schools have done so
little, till of late, to cultivate this fine taste, that
we have faint reason to expect it in our teachers.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed as we are with the folly of indulging
in the praise of literature before many whose
ears have been but poorly attuned to the sweet
melody or majestic rhythm of the masters, we still
make bold to grapple with this argument. There
is surely no subject to which the teachers need more
to open their eyes and ears and better nature, so as to
take in the enrichment it affords. There is encouragement
in the fact that many teachers fully appreciate
the worth of these writers, and have succeeded
in making their works beautiful and educative to
the children. Very many other teachers are capable
of the full refreshing enjoyment of classic works,
when their attention and labor are properly expended
upon them. The colleges, universities, high schools,
and normal schools have largely abandoned the dull
epitomizing of literature, the talk about authors, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the study of the works themselves of the masters.
The consequence is, that the study of literature in
English is becoming an enthusiasm, and teachers
of this type are multiplying.</p>

<p>The deeper causes for this widespread lack of
literary appreciation among the people, and even
among teachers and scholars, is found partly in the
practical, scientific, and utilitarian spirit of the age,
and partly in the corresponding unliterary courses
of study which have prevailed everywhere in our
common schools. The absence of literary standards
and taste among teachers is due largely to the
failure of the schools themselves, hitherto, to cultivate
this sort of proficiency. Those very qualities
which give to literature its supreme excellence, its
poetic beauty, its artistic finish and idealism, are
among the highest fruits of culture, and are far
more difficult of attainment than mere knowledge.
It is no small thing to introduce the rarest and
finest culture of the world into the common school, and
thus propagate, in the broadest democratic fashion,
that which is the peculiar, superior refinement of the
choicest spirits of the world. If progress in this
direction is slow, we may remember that the best
ideals are slow of attainment.</p>

<p>There is also an intangible quality in all first-class
literature, which is not capable of exact description
or demonstration. George Willis Cooke, in "Poets
and Problems" (pp. 31-32), says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poetry enters into those higher regions of human
experience concerning which no definite account can
be given; where all words fail; about which all we
know is to be obtained by hints, symbols, poetic
figures, and imagings. Poetry is truer and more
helpful than prose, because it penetrates those
regions of feeling, beauty, and spiritual reality,
where definitions have no place or justification.
There would be no poetry if life were limited to
what we can understand; nor would there be any
religion. Indeed, the joy, the beauty, and the
promise of life would all be gone if there were
nothing which reaches beyond our powers of definition.
The mystery of existence makes the grandeur
and worth of man's nature, as it makes for him his
poetry and his religion. Poetry suggests, hints,
images forth, what is too wonderful, too transcendent,
too near primal reality, too full of life, beauty,
and joy, for explanation or comprehension. It
embodies man's longing after the Eternal One,
expresses his sense of the deep mystery of Being,
voices his soul sorrow, illumines his path with hope
and objects of beauty. Man's aspiration, his sense
of imperfection, his yearning for a sustaining truth
and reality, as the life within and over all things,
find expression in poetry; because it offers the
fittest medium of interpretation for these higher
movements of soul. Whenever the soul feels deeply,
or is stirred by a great thought, the poetic form of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
utterance at once becomes the most natural and
desirable for its loving and faithful interpretation."</p>

<p>This intangible excellence of superior literature,
which defies all exact measurement by the yardstick,
puzzles the practical man and the scientist.
There is no way of getting at it with their tools
and measurements. They are very apt to give it
up in disgust and dismiss it with some uncomplimentary
name. But Shakespeare's mild reign continues,
and old Homer sings his deathless song to
those who wish to hear.</p>

<p>Teachers need both the exact methods of science
and the spiritual life of the poets, and we may well
spend some pains in finding out the life-giving properties
of good literature.</p>

<p>Lowell, in his "Books and Libraries," says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To wash down the drier morsels that every
library must necessarily offer at its board, let there
be plenty of imaginative literature, and let its range
be not too narrow to stretch from Dante to the elder
Dumas. The world of the imagination is not the
world of abstraction and nonentity, as some conceive,
but a world formed out of chaos by a sense of the
beauty that is in man and the earth on which he
dwells. It is the realm of Might-be, our haven of
refuge from the shortcomings and disillusions of life.
It is, to quote Spenser, who knew it well,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The world's sweet inn from care and wearisome
turmoil.' Do we believe, then, that God gave us in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
mockery this splendid faculty of sympathy with
things that are a joy forever? For my part, I
believe that the love and study of works of imagination
is of practical utility in a country so profoundly
material (or, as we like to call it, practical) in its
leading tendencies as ours. The hunger after purely
intellectual delights, the content with ideal possessions,
cannot but be good for us in maintaining a
wholesome balance of the character and of the faculties.
I for one shall never be persuaded that
Shakespeare left a less useful legacy to his countrymen
than Watt. We hold all the deepest, all the
highest, satisfactions of life as tenants of imagination.
Nature will keep up the supply of what are called
hard-headed people without our help, and, if it come
to that, there are other as good uses for heads as at
the end of battering-rams."</p>

<p>"But have you ever rightly considered what the
mere ability to read means? That it is the key which
admits us to the whole world of thought and fancy
and imagination? to the company of saint and sage,
of the wisest and wittiest at their wisest and wittiest
moments? That it enables us to see with the keenest
eyes, hear with the finest ears, and listen to the
sweetest voices of all time? More than that, it
annihilates time and space for us; it revives for us
without a miracle the Age of Wonder, endowing us
with the shoes of swiftness and the cap of darkness,
so that we walk invisible like fern-seed, and witness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
unharmed the plague at Athens or Florence or
London; accompany C&aelig;sar on his marches, or look
in on Catiline in council with his fellow-conspirators,
or Guy Fawkes in the cellar of St. Stephen's. We
often hear of people who will descend to any servility,
submit to any insult, for the sake of getting themselves
or their children into what is euphemistically
called good society. Did it ever occur to them that
there is a select society of all the centuries to which
they and theirs can be admitted for the asking, a
society, too, which will not involve them in ruinous
expense, and still more ruinous waste of time and
health and faculties?</p>

<p>"The riches of scholarship, the benignities of literature,
defy fortune and outlive calamity. They
are beyond the reach of thief or moth or rust. As
they cannot be inherited, so they cannot be alienated.
But they may be shared, they may be distributed."</p>

<p>This notion of the select companionship of books
finds also happy expression in Ruskin's "Sesame
and Lilies":&mdash;</p>

<p>"We may intrude ten minutes' talk on a cabinet
minister, answered probably with words worse than
silence, being deceptive; or snatch, once or twice in
our lives, the privilege of throwing a bouquet in the
path of a princess, or arresting the kind glance of
a queen. And yet these momentary chances we
covet; and spend our years, and passions, and
powers in pursuit of little more than these; while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
meantime, there is a society continually open to us,
of people who will talk to us as long as we like,
whatever our rank or occupation;&mdash;talk to us in
the best words they can choose, and with thanks
if we listen to them. And this society, because it is
so numerous and so gentle,&mdash;and can be kept waiting
round us all day long, not to grant audience, but
to gain it; kings and statesmen lingering patiently
in those plainly furnished and narrow anterooms, our
bookcase shelves,&mdash;we make no account of that
company,&mdash;perhaps never listen to a word they
would say, all day long!</p>

<p>"This court of the past differs from all living
aristocracy in this: it is open to labor and to
merit, but to nothing else. No wealth will bribe,
no name overawe, no artifice deceive, the guardian
of those Elysian gates. In the deep sense, no vile
or vulgar person ever enters there. At the porti&egrave;res
of that silent Faubourg St.-Germain, there is but
brief question, 'Do you deserve to enter?' 'Pass.
Do you ask to be the companions of nobles? Make
yourself noble, and you shall be. Do you long for
the conversation of the wise? Learn to understand
it, and you shall hear it. But on other terms?&mdash;no.
If you will not rise to us, we cannot stoop to
you. The living lord may assume courtesy, the
living philosopher explain his thought to you with
considerable pain; but here we neither feign nor
interpret; you must rise to the level of our thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
if you would be gladdened by them, and share our
feelings, if you would recognize our presence.'"</p>

<p>Wordsworth says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">"Books, we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are a substantial world, both pure and good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our pastime and our happiness will grow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Carlyle says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We learn to read, in various languages, in
various sciences; we learn the alphabet and letters
of all manner of Books. But the place where we
are to get knowledge, even theoretic knowledge, is
the Books themselves! It depends on what we read,
after all manner of Professors have done their best
for us. The true University of these days is a
Collection of Books."</p>

<p>Were we willing to accept the testimony of great
writers and thinkers, we should but too quickly
acknowledge the supreme value of books. James
Baldwin, in the first chapter of his "Book Lover,"
has collected more than a score of like utterances
of great writers "In Praise of Books." Such testimony
may at least suggest to some of us who
have drunk but sparingly of the refreshing springs
of literature, that there are better things in store
for us.</p>

<p>We will first inquire into those vital elements of
strength which are peculiar to literature.</p>

<p>One of the elements that goes into the make-up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of a masterpiece of literature is its underlying, permanent
truth. Whether written to-day or in earlier
centuries, it must contain lasting qualities that do
not fade away or bleach out or decay. Time and
weather do not stain or destroy its merit. Some
classics, as Gray's "Elegy," or "Thanatopsis," are
like cut diamonds. The quality that gives them
force and brilliancy is inherent, and the form in
which they appear has been wrought out by an
artist. The fundamental value of a classic is the
deep, significant truth which, like the grain in fine
woods, is wrought into its very structure. The artist
who moulds a masterpiece like "Enoch Arden" or
"The Scarlet Letter" is not a writer of temporary
fame. The truth to which he feels impelled to give
expression is strong, natural, human truth, which has
no beginning and no end. It is true forever. Schiller's
William Tell, though idealized, is a human
hero with the hearty thoughts of a real man. Shylock
is a Jew of flesh and blood, who will laugh if
he is tickled, and break into anger if he is thwarted.
The true poet builds upon eternal foundations. The
bookmaker or rhymer is satisfied with empty or fleeting
thoughts and with a passing notoriety. New
books are often caught up and blazoned as classics
which a few years reveal as patchwork and tinsel.
Time is a sure test. Showy tinsel rusts and dulls
its lustre, while simple poetic truth shines with growing
brightness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Schlegel, in his "Dramatic Art and Literature,"
thus contrasts the false and the true (pp. 18-19):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poetry, taken in its widest acceptation, as the
power of creating what is beautiful, and representing
it to the eye or the ear, is a universal gift of
Heaven, being shared to a certain extent even by
those whom we call barbarians and savages. Internal
excellence is alone decisive, and where this
exists we must not allow ourselves to be repelled by
the external appearance. Everything must be traced
up to the root of human nature: if it has sprung
from thence, it has an undoubted worth of its own;
but if, without possessing a living germ, it is merely
externally attached thereto, it will never thrive nor
acquire a proper growth. Many productions which
appear at first sight dazzling phenomena in the province
of the fine arts, and which as a whole have been
honored with the appellation of works of a golden
age, resemble the mimic gardens of children: impatient
to witness the work of their hands, they break
off here and there branches and flowers, and plant
them in the earth; everything at first assumes a noble
appearance: the childish gardener struts proudly up
and down among his showy beds, till the rootless
plants begin to droop, and hang their withered leaves
and blossoms, and nothing soon remains but the bare
twigs, while the dark forest, on which no art or care
was ever bestowed, and which towered up toward
heaven long before human remembrance, bears every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
blast unshaken, and fills the solitary beholder with
religious awe."</p>

<p>In his "Poets and Problems," George Willis
Cooke fitly portrays the poet's function (pp. 42, 32,
and 44):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The poet must be either a teacher or an artist;
or, what is better, he may be both in one. Therefore,
he can never stop at form or at what delights
and charms merely. He must go on to the expression
of something of deep and real abidingness of
thought and beauty. This comes at last to be the
real thing for which he works, which he seeks to bring
into expression with such power and grandeur in it as
he can produce, and which he wills to send forth for
the sake of this higher impression on the world."</p>

<p>"Man has within him a need for the food which
does not perish; he always is finding anew that he
cannot live by bread alone. His mind will crave
truth, his heart love, somewhat to satisfy the inward
needs of life. A heavenly homesickness will draw
him away from the material to those &aelig;sthetic and
spiritual realities which are at the source of the truest
poetry. Whenever these wants find fit interpretation,
the poet and the poetic method of expression
appear and give to them outward forms of beauty.
Consequently the poet is</p>

<p>"The true poet is the man of his time who is most
alive, who feels, sees, and knows the most. In the
measure of his life he is the greatest man of his age
and country. His eye sees farther and more clearly;
his heart beats more warmly and with a more universal
sympathy; his thought runs deeper and with
a swifter current, than is the case with other men.
He is the oracle and guide, the inspirer and the
friend, of those to whom he sings. He creates life
under the ribs of dead tradition; he illumines the
present with heart flames of beaconing truth, and he
makes the future seem like home joys far off, but
drawing ever nigher. The poet is the world's
lover."</p>

<p>Emerson found the Greeks standing as close
to nature and truth as himself ("Essay on History"):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and
indeed of all old literature, is, that the persons speak
simply,&mdash;speak as persons who have great good
sense without knowing it, before yet the reflective
habit has become the predominant habit of the mind.
Our admiration of the antique is not admiration of
the old, but of the natural. The Greeks are not
reflective, but perfect in their senses and in their
health, with the finest physical organization in the
world. Adults acted with the simplicity and grace
of children."</p>

<p>In his "Defence of Poetry" Shelley says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poetry thus makes immortal all that is best and
most beautiful in the world; it arrests the vanishing
apparitions which haunt the interlunations of life,
and, veiling them or in language or in form, sends
them forth among mankind, bearing sweet news
of kindred joy to those with whom their sisters
abide&mdash;abide, because there is no portal of expression
from the caverns of the spirit which they
inhabit into the universe of things. Poetry redeems
from decay the visitations of the divinity in man."</p>

<p>Carlyle, in his "Heroes and Hero-worship,"
portrays the deeper art and insight of the poet
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For my own part, I find considerable meaning in
the old vulgar distinction of Poetry being metrical,
having music in it, being a Song. Truly, if pressed
to give a definition, one might say this as soon as
anything else: If your delineation be authentically
musical, musical not in word only, but in heart and
substance, in all the thoughts and utterances of it,
in the whole conception of it, then it will be poetical;
if not, not. Musical: how much lies in that! A
musical thought is one spoken by a mind that has
penetrated into the inmost heart of the thing; detected
the inmost mystery of it, namely the melody
that lies hidden in it; the inward harmony of coherence
which is its soul, whereby it exists, and has a
right to be, here in this world. All inmost things,
we may say, are melodious; naturally utter them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>selves
in Song. The meaning of Song goes deep.
Who is there that, in logical words, can express the
effect music has upon us? A kind of inarticulate
unfathomable speech, which leads us to the edge of
the Infinite, and lets us for moments gaze into that!</p>

<p>"Nay all speech, even the commonest speech, has
something of song in it: not a parish in the world
but has its parish-accent;&mdash;the rhythm or tune to
which the people there sing what they have to say!
Accent is a kind of chanting; all men have accent
of their own,&mdash;though they only notice that of others.
Observe, too, how all passionate language does of
itself become musical,&mdash;with a finer music than the
mere accent; the speech of a man even in zealous
anger becomes a chant, a song. All deep things are
Song. It seems somehow the very central essence
of us, Song; as if all the rest were but wrappages
and hulls. The primal element of us; of us, and of
all things. The Greeks fabled of Sphere-Harmonies:
it was the feeling they had of the inner structure of
Nature; that the soul of all her voices and utterances
was perfect music. Poetry, therefore, we will call
musical Thought. The Poet is he who thinks in
that manner. At bottom, it turns still on power of
intellect; it is a man's sincerity and depth of vision
that makes him a Poet. See deep enough, and you
see musically; the heart of Nature being everywhere
music, if you can only reach it."</p>

<p>"Or indeed we may say again, it is in what I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
called Portrait-painting, delineating of men and
things, especially of men, that Shakespeare is great.
All the greatness of the man comes out decisively
here. It is unexampled, I think, that calm creative
perspicacity of Shakespeare. The thing he looks
at reveals not this or that face of it, but its inmost
heart, and generic secret: it dissolves itself as in
light before him, so that he discerns the perfect
structure of it. Creative, we said: poetic creation,
what is this, too, but seeing the thing sufficiently?
The word that will describe the thing, follows of
itself from such clear intense sight of the thing.
And is not Shakespeare's morality, his valor, candor,
tolerance, truthfulness; his whole victorious strength
and greatness, which can triumph over such obstructions,
visible there too? Great as the world! No
twisted, poor convex-concave mirror, reflecting all
objects with its own convexities and concavities; a
perfectly level mirror,&mdash;that is to say withal, if we
will understand it, a man justly related to all things
and men, a good man. It is truly a lordly spectacle
how this great soul takes in all kinds of men and
objects, a Falstaff, an Othello, a Juliet, a Coriolanus;
sets them all forth to us in their round completeness;
loving, just, the equal brother of all. 'Novum
Organum,' and all the intellect you will find in
Bacon, is of a quite secondary order; earthy, material,
poor in comparison with this. Among modern
men, one finds, in strictness, almost nothing of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
same rank. Goethe alone, since the days of Shakespeare,
reminds me of it. Of him, too, you say that
he saw the object; you may say what he himself
says of Shakespeare, 'His characters are like watches
with dial-plates of transparent crystal; they show
you the hour like others, and the inward mechanism
also is all visible.'"</p>

<p>"Dante, for depth of sincerity, is like an antique
Prophet, too; his words, like theirs, come from his
very heart. One need not wonder if it were predicted
that his Poem might be the most enduring
thing our Europe has yet made; for nothing so
endures as a truly spoken word. All cathedrals,
pontificalities, brass and stone, and outer arrangement
never so lasting, are brief in comparison to an
unfathomable heart-song like this: one feels as if
it might survive, still of importance to men, when
these had all sunk into new irrecognizable combinations,
and had ceased individually to be. Europe
has made much; great cities, great empires, encyclop&aelig;dias,
creeds, bodies of opinion and practice: but
it has made little of the class of Dante's Thought.
Homer yet is, veritably present face to face with
every open soul of us; and Greece, where is it?
Desolate for thousands of years; away, vanished;
a bewildered heap of stones and rubbish, the life
and existence of it all gone. Like a dream; like
the dust of King Agamemnon! Greece was; Greece,
except in the words it spoke, is not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>J. C. Shairp, in his "On Poetic Interpretation of
Nature" (p. 19), says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The real nature and intrinsic truth of Poetry will
be made more apparent, if we may turn aside for
a moment to reflect on the essence of that state of
mind which we call poetic, the genesis of that creation
which we call Poetry. Whenever any object of
sense, or spectacle of the outer world, any truth of
reason, or event of past history, any fact of human
experience, any moral or spiritual reality; whenever,
in short, any fact or object which the sense, or the
intellect, or the soul, or the spirit of man can apprehend,
comes home to one so as to touch him to the
quick, to pierce him with a more than usual vividness
and sense of reality, then is awakened that
stirring of the imagination, that glow of emotion, in
which Poetry is born. There is no truth cognizable
by man which may not shape itself into Poetry."</p>

<p>The passages just quoted are but examples of
many that might be cited expressing the strength
and scope of the poetic spirit, its truth-revealing
quality, its penetrating yet comprehensive grasp of
the realities. Shelley says, "A poem is the very
image of life expressed in its eternal truth"; and
Wordsworth that poetry is "the breath and finer spirit
of all knowledge." These utterances will hardly be
deemed poetical extravagancies to one who has read
such things as the Ninetieth Psalm, "King Lear," or
"The Deserted Village," or "Elaine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no form of inspiring truth which does not
find expression in literature, but it is pre&euml;minently a
revelation of human life and experience, a proclamation
from the housetops of the supreme beauty and
excellence of truth and virtue. This brings us close
to the question of moral education, and the elements
in literature that contribute to this end. Literary
critics are quick to take alarm at the propensity of the
schoolmaster and the moralist to make literature the
vehicle of moral training. To saddle the poets with
a moral purpose would be like changing Pegasus into
a plough-horse. But the moral quality in the best
literature is not something saddled on, it is rather
like the frame and muscle which give strength to
the body, or, to use a more fitting figure, it is the
very pulse and heart-beat of the highest idealism.
The proneness toward moralizing, toward formal
didacticism, can be best of all corrected by the use
of choice literature. The best literature is free from
moral pedantry, but full of moral suggestion and
stimulus. Edmund Clarence Stedman says, in his
"Nature and Elements of Poetry" (p. 216):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The highest wisdom&mdash;that of ethics&mdash;seems
closely affiliated with poetic truth. A prosaic moral
is injurious to virtue, by making it repulsive. The
moment goodness becomes tedious and unideal in a
work of art, it is not real goodness; the would-be
artist, though a very saint, has mistaken his form of
expression. On the other hand, extreme beauty and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
power in a poem or picture always carry a moral,
they are inseparable from a certain ethical standard;
while vice suggests a depravity.... An obtrusive
moral in poetic form is a fraud on its face, and outlawed
of art. But that all great poetry is essentially
ethical is plain from any consideration of Homer,
Dante, and the best dramatists and lyrists, old and
new."</p>

<p>In literature, as in life, those persons make the
strongest moral impression who have the least express
discussion of morals. Their actions speak, and
the moral qualities appear, not in didactic formality
and isolation, but in their life setting. This is seen
in the great dramas, novels, and epic poems.</p>

<p>These masterpieces are of strong and lasting value
to the schools because they bring out human conduct
and character in a rich variety of forms corresponding
to life. Against the background of scenery created
by the poet, men and women and children march
along to their varied performances. Theseus, Ulysses,
Crusoe, Aladdin, Alfred, Horatius, Cinderella, Portia,
Evangeline,&mdash;they speak and act before us with all
the realism and fidelity to human instincts peculiar to
the poet's art. These men and women, who are set
in action before us, stir up all our dormant thought-energy.
We observe and judge their motives and
approve or condemn their actions. We are stirred to
sympathy or pity or anger. Such an intense study
of motives and conduct, as offered in literature, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
like a fresh spring from which well up strengthening
waters. The warmth and energy with which judgments
are passed upon the deeds of children and
adults is the original source of moral ideas. Literature
is especially rich in opportunities to register
these convictions. It is not the bare knowledge of
right and wrong developed, but the deep springs of
feeling and emotion are opened, which gush up into
volitions and acts.</p>

<p>Just as we form opinions of people from their
individual acts, and draw inferences as to their character
and motives, so the overt act of Brutus or of
Miles Standish stands out so clear against the background
of passing events that an unerring judgment
falls upon the doer. A single act, seen in its relations,
always calls forth such a sentence of good or
ill. Whether it be a gentle deed of mercy, or the
hammer-stroke that fells a giant or routs an army, as
with Charles Martel or Alfred, the sense of right or
wrong is the deep underflow that gives meaning to all
events and stamps character.</p>

<p>There is, however, a deeper and more intense moral
teaching in literature than that which flows from the
right or wrong of individual acts. The whole life
and evolution of character in a person, if graphically
drawn, reveal the principles of conduct and their
fruitage. Character is a growth. Deeds are only
the outward signs of the direction in which the soul
is moving. A dramatist like Shakespeare, or a novel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ist
like George Eliot, gives us a biographical development.
Deeds are done which leave their traces.
Tendencies are formed which grow into habits, and
thus a character ripens steadily toward its reward.
We become conscious that certain deeper principles
control thought and action, whether good or bad.
There is a rule of law, a sort of fatalism, in human
life. "The mills of the gods grind slow, but they
grind exceeding small." It is the function of the
dramatist or novelist to reveal these working principles
in conduct. When the principle adopted by the
actor is a good one, it works out well-being in spite of
misfortunes; when evil, the furies are on the track of
the evil-doer. Men do not gather grapes of thorns
or figs of thistles. As we move on from step to step
in a life-history, the sympathy deepens. The fatal
influence of a false step, followed up, is keenly felt
by the reader; the upward tendency of a right act
inspires and lifts into freedom. But whether we love
or hate or pity, the character moves on in the course
which his deeds mark out. When finally he is overwhelmed
in shame and defeat, we see the early tendencies
and later forces which have led to this result.
If ethical triumph is achieved, we recognize the reward
of generous, unselfish impulses followed out.</p>

<p>As the interest in such a life-history deepens, the
lessons it evolves come out with convincing and
overwhelming power. The effect of a great novel
or drama is more intense and lasting than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
sermon. The elements of thought and feeling have
been accumulating energy and momentum through
all the scenes, and when contracted into a single
current at the close they sweep forward with the
strength of a river. A masterpiece works at the
foundations of our sympathies and moral judgments.
To bring ourselves under the spell of a great author
and to allow him, hour after hour and perhaps for
days in succession, to sway our feelings and rule
far up among the sources of our moral judgments,
is to give him great opportunity to stamp our character
with his convictions. We seldom spend so
many hours in close companionship with a living
friend as with some master of the art of character-delineation.
Children are susceptible to this strong
influence. Many of them take easily to books, and
many others need but wise direction to bring them
under the touch of their formative influence. A
book sometimes produces a more lasting effect upon
the character and conduct of a child than a close
companion. Nor is this true only in the case of
book-lovers. It is probable that the great majority
of children may feel the wholesome effect of such
books if wisely used at the right time. To select
a few of the best books as companions to a child,
and teach him to love their companionship, is one
of the most hopeful things in education. The boy
or girl who reads some of our choice epics, stories,
novels, dramas, and biographies, allowing the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to ponder upon the problems of conduct involved,
will receive many deep and permanent moral lessons.
The realism with which the artist clothes his characters
only strengthens the effect and makes them
lasting food for thought in the coming years. Even
in early childhood we are able to detect what is
noble and debasing in conduct as thus graphically
and naturally revealed, and a child forms an unerring
judgment along moral lines. The best influence that
literature has to bestow, therefore, may produce its effect
early in tender years, where impressions are deep
and permanent. There are many other elements of
lasting culture-value in the study of literature, but
first of all the deep and permanent truths taught by
the classics are those of human life and conduct.</p>

<p>George Willis Cooke gives clear and simple expression
to the ethical force in poetry ("Poets and
Problems," p. 46):&mdash;</p>

<p>"True poetry is for instruction as much as for
pleasure, though it inculcate no formal lessons.
Right moral teaching is by example far more than
by precept; and the real poet teaches through the
higher purpose he arouses, by the stimulus he gives,
and by the purer motive he awakens. He gives
no precept to recite, no homilies to con over, no rules
for formal repetition; but he gives the spirit of life
and the impulse of true activity. An infallible test
of the great poet is that he inspires us with a sense
of the richness and grandeur of life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Rooted in the genuine realism of social life, moral
ideas are still more strongly energized by feeling and
even by passion. It is doubtful if moral ideas have
any roots that do not reach down into deep and
genuine feeling.</p>

<p>Ruskin, in "Sesame and Lilies," speaks to the
point.</p>

<p>"Having then faithfully listened to the great
teachers, that you may enter into their Thoughts,
you have yet this higher advance to make,&mdash;you
have to enter into their Hearts. As you go to them
first for clear sight, so you must stay with them that
you may share at last their just and mighty Passion.
Passion, or "sensation." I am not afraid of the
word; still less of the thing. You have heard many
outcries against sensation lately; but, I can tell you,
it is not less sensation we want, but more. The ennobling
difference between one man and another&mdash;between
one animal and another&mdash;is precisely in
this, that one feels more than another. If we were
sponges, perhaps sensation might not be easily got
for us; if we were earthworms, liable at every
instant to be cut in two by the spade, perhaps too
much sensation might not be good for us. But,
being human creatures, it is good for us; nay, we
are only human in so far as we are sensitive, and
our honor is precisely in proportion to our passion.</p>

<p>"You know I said of that great and pure society
of the dead, that it would allow 'no vain or vulgar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
person to enter there.' What do you think I meant
by a 'vulgar' person? What do you yourselves
mean by 'vulgarity'? You will find it a fruitful
subject of thought; but, briefly, the essence of all
vulgarity lies in want of sensation. Simple and innocent
vulgarity is merely an untrained and undeveloped
bluntness of body and mind; but in true
inbred vulgarity, there is a deathful callousness,
which, in extremity, becomes capable of every sort
of bestial habit and crime, without fear, without
pleasure, without horror, and without pity. It is in
the blunt hand and the dead heart, in the diseased
habit, in the hardened conscience, that men become
vulgar; they are forever vulgar, precisely in proportion
as they are incapable of sympathy,&mdash;of
quick understanding,&mdash;of all that, in deep insistence
on the common, but most accurate term, may
be called the 'tact' or touch-faculty of body and
soul; that tact which the Mimosa has in trees, which
the pure woman has above all creatures,&mdash;fineness
and fulness of sensation, beyond reason,&mdash;the guide
and sanctifier of reason itself. Reason can but determine
what is true: it is the God-given passion of
humanity which alone can recognize what God has
made good.</p>

<p>"We come then to the great concourse of the Dead,
not merely to know from them what is True, but
chiefly to feel with them, what is Righteous. Now
to feel with them we must be like them; and none<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of us can become that without pains. As the true
knowledge is disciplined and tested knowledge,&mdash;not
the first thought that comes,&mdash;so the true passion
is disciplined and tested passion,&mdash;not the first
passion that comes."</p>

<p>When we add to this deep feeling and sympathy
the versatile poetic imagination which freely constructs
all phases of social life and conduct, we have
that union of the great powers of the mind and heart
which give such concentrated ethical energy to the
best literature.</p>

<p>Shelley, in his "Defence of Poetry" (pp. 13-14,
20), says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The whole objection, however, of the immorality
of poetry rests upon a misconception of the
manner in which poetry acts to produce the moral
improvement of man. Ethical science arranges
the elements which poetry has created, and propounds
schemes and proposes examples of civil and
domestic life; nor is it for want of admirable doctrines
that men hate, and despise, and censure,
and deceive, and subjugate one another. But
poetry acts in another and diviner manner. It
awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering
it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations
of thought. Poetry lifts the veil from the
hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar
objects be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces
all that it represents, and the impersonations clothed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in its Elysian light stand thenceforward in the minds
of those who have once contemplated them, as
memorials of that gentle and exalted content which
extends itself over all thoughts and actions with
which it coexists. The great secret of morals is
love; or a going out of our own nature, and an
identification of ourselves with the beautiful which
exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A
man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely
and comprehensively; he must put himself in the
place of another and of many others; the pains
and pleasures of his species must become his own.
The great instrument of moral good is the imagination;
and poetry administers to the effect by acting
upon the cause."</p>

<p>"The drama being that form under which a
greater number of modes of expression of poetry
are susceptible of being combined than any other,
the connection of poetry and social good is more
observable in the drama than in whatever other
form. And it is indisputable that the highest perfection
of human society has ever corresponded with
the highest dramatic excellence; and that the corruption
or the extinction of the drama in a nation where
it has once flourished, is a mark of corruption of
manners, and an extinction of the energies which
sustain the soul of social life."</p>

<p>The inseparable union of the intellectual, moral,
and imaginative elements is well expressed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Shairp in his "On Poetic Interpretation of
Nature" (pp. 23-24):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Imagination in its essence seems to be, from the
first, intellect and feeling blended and interpenetrating
each other. Thus it would seem that purely
intellectual acts belong to the surface and outside
of our nature,&mdash;as you pass onward to the depths,
the more vital places of the soul, the intellectual,
the emotional, and the moral elements are all equally
at work,&mdash;and this in virtue of their greater reality,
their more essential truth, their nearer contact with
the centre of things. To this region belong all
acts of high imagination&mdash;the region intermediate
between pure understanding and moral affection,
partaking of both elements, looking equally both
ways."</p>

<p>Besides the moral element or fundamental truth involved,
every classic masterpiece is infused therefore
with an element of imagination. Whether in prose or
verse, the artist reveals himself in the creative touch.
The rich coloring and imagery of his own mind give
a tint to every object. The literary artist is never
lacking in a certain, perhaps indefinable, charm. He
possesses a magic wand that transforms into beauty
every commonplace object that is met. We observe
this in Irving, Hawthorne, Warner, as well as in still
greater literary masters. Our poets, novelists, and
essayists must all dip their pens in this magic ink.
Even Webster and Burke, Lincoln and Sumner, must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
rise to the region of fancy if they give their thought
sufficient strength of wing to carry it into the coming
years. The themes upon which they discoursed
kindled the imagination and caused them to break
forth into figures of speech and poetic license. The
creative fancy is that which gives beauty, picturesqueness,
and charm to all the work of poet or
novelist. This element of fancy diffuses itself as
a living glow through every classic product that
was made to endure. In the masters of style the
rhythmic flow and energy of language are enlivened
by poetic imagery. Figures of speech in architectural
simplicity and chasteness stand out to symbolize
thought. That keenness and originality which
astonishes us in master thinkers is due to the magic
vigor and picturesqueness of their images. Underneath
and permeating all this wealth of ideas is
the versatile and original mind which sees everything
in the glow of its own poetic temperament, kindling
the susceptible reader to like inspiration.
Among literary masters this creative power shows
itself in an infinite variety of forms, pours itself
through a hundred divergent channels, and links
itself so closely with the individuality of the writer
as to merge imperceptibly into his character and
style. But as we cannot secure wholesome bread
without yeast, so we shall fail of a classic without
imagination.</p>

<p>Stedman says: "If anything great has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
achieved without exercise of the imagination, I do
not know it. I am referring to striking productions
and achievements, not to acts of virtue. Nevertheless,
at the last analysis, it might be found that
imagination has impelled even the saints and
martyrs of humanity. Imagination is the creative
origin of what is fine, not in art and song alone,
but also in all forms of action&mdash;in campaigns, civil
triumphs, material conquest. I have mentioned its
indispensability to the scientists." He says further:
"Yet if there is one gift which sets Shakespeare at
a distance even from those who approach him on
one or another side, it is that of his imagination.
As he is the chief of poets, we infer that the faculty
in which he is supereminent must be the greatest of
poetic endowments. Yes: in his wonderland, as
elsewhere, imagination is king."</p>

<p>Not only is it true that the vitality of poets and
prose writers, the conceptive power of scientists,
inventors, and business organizers, depend upon
the fertility and strength of the imagination, but
throughout the broader reaches of common humanity
this power is everywhere present&mdash;constructive
and creative. Max M&uuml;ller has shown that the
root words of language are imbedded in metaphor,
that "Language is fossil poetry." Again, the
mythologies of the different races, grand and stately,
or fair and lovely, are the immediate product of
the folk mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been said that "The man of culture is
pre&euml;minently a man of imagination." But the
kind of mental alertness, freedom, and joy which is
suggested by the term <i>culture</i> may spring up in the
heart of every boy and girl endowed with a modicum
of human nature. Hamilton Wright Mabie, in his
"Books and Culture" (pp. 148-149), says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The development of the imagination, upon the
power of which both absorption of knowledge and
creative capacity depend, is, therefore, a matter of
supreme importance. To this necessity educators
will some day open their eyes, and educational systems
will some day conform; meantime, it must be
done mainly by individual work. Knowledge, discipline,
and technical training of the best sort are
accessible on every hand; but the development of
the faculty which unites all these in the highest form
of activity must be secured mainly by personal effort.
The richest and most accessible material for this
highest education is furnished by art; and the form
of art within reach of every civilized man, at all
times, in all places, is the book. To these masterpieces,
which have been called the books of life, all
men may turn with the assurance that as the supreme
achievements of the imagination they have the power
of awakening, stimulating, and enriching it in the
highest degree."</p>

<p>Besides the strong thread of truth and the work
of the swift-glancing shuttle of imagination, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
woven fabric of the literary master must show a
beauteous pattern or form. The melody and music
of poetry spring from a rhythmic form. Apparently
stiff and formal, it is yet the consensus of
critics that only through this channel can the soul
of truth and beauty escape from the poet, and manifest
itself to others. Says George Willis Cooke,
"The poet worships at the triple shrine of beauty,
love, and truth; and his mission is to teach men that
all other objects and places of veneration are but
faint imitations of this one form of faith." But the
spirit of this worship can best embody itself in the
poetic form.</p>

<p>Schlegel, in his "Dramatic Art and Literature"
(p. 340), says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The works of genius cannot therefore be permitted
to be without form; but of this there is no
danger.... [Some] critics ... interpret it [form]
merely in a mechanical, and not in an organical
sense.... Organical form, again, is innate; it
unfolds itself from within, and acquires its determination
contemporaneously with the perfect development
of the germ. We everywhere discover such
forms in nature throughout the whole range of living
powers, from the crystallization of salts and minerals
to plants and flowers, and from these again to the
human body. In the fine arts, as well as in the
domain of nature,&mdash;the supreme artist,&mdash;all genuine
forms are organical, that is, determined by the qual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>ity
of the work. In a word, the form is nothing but
a significant exterior, the speaking physiognomy of
each thing, which, as long as it is not disfigured by
any destructive accident, gives a true evidence of its
hidden essence."</p>

<p>Some products, like the "Paradise Lost," "Thanatopsis,"
and "Hamlet," show such a perfect fitness of
form to thought that every effort to change or modify
is profanation. The classic form and thought go
together. As far as possible, therefore, it is desirable
to leave these creations in their native strength,
and not to mar the work of masters. The poet has
moulded his thought and feeling into these forms
and transfused them with his own imagery and individuality.
The power of the writer is in his peculiar
mingling of the poetic elements. Our English and
American classics, therefore, should be read in their
original form as far as possible.</p>

<p>A fixed form is not always necessary. We need
many of the stories and epics that were written in
other languages. Fortunately some of the works of
the old poets are capable of taking on a new dress.
The story of Ulysses has been told in verse and
prose, in translation, paraphrase, and simple narrative
for children. Much, indeed of the old
beauty and original strength of the poem is lost in
all these renderings; but the central truths which
give the poetic work its persistent value are still
retained. Such a poem is like a person; the under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>lying
thought, though dressed up by different persons
with varying taste and skill, is yet the same;
the same heart beats beneath the kingly robes and
the peasant's frock. Robinson Crusoe has had many
renderings, but remains the same old story in spite of
variations. The Bible has been translated into all
modern tongues, but it is a classic in each. The Germans
claim they have as good a Shakespeare as we.</p>

<p>But many of the best masterpieces were originally
written in other languages, and to be of use to us the
ancient form of thought must be broken. The spirit
of the old masters must be poured into new moulds.
In educating our children we need the stories of
Bellerophon, Perseus, Hercules, Rustum, Tell, Siegfried,
Virginius, Roland, Wallace, King Arthur.
Happily some of the best modern writers have come
to our help. Walter Scott, Macaulay, Dickens,
Kingsley, Hawthorne, Irving, and Arnold have
gathered up the old wine and poured it into new
bottles. They have told the old stories in simple
Anglo-Saxon for the boys and girls of our homes
and schools. Nor are these renderings of the old
masters lacking in that element of fancy and vigor
of expression which distinguishes fertile writers.
They have entered freely and fondly into the old
spirit, and have allowed it to pour itself copiously
through these modern channels. It takes a poet, in
fact, to modernize an ancient story. There are,
indeed, many renderings of the old stories which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
are not ideal, which, however, we sometimes use for
lack of anything better.</p>

<p>From the preceding discussion we may conclude
that a choice piece of literature must embody a lasting
truth, reveal the permeating glow of an artist's
imagination, and find expression in some form of
beauty. But these elements are so mingled and
interlaced, so organically grown into one living plant,
that even the critics have given up the effort to
dissect and isolate them.</p>

<p>There are other strength-conferring qualities in
good literature which will be discussed more fully in
those chapters which deal with the particular literary
materials selected for use in the schools.</p>

<p>Among the topics to be treated in connection with
materials which illustrate them, are the following:
the strong handling of essential historical ideas in
literature; the best novel and drama, as sources and
means of culture; religious ideals as embodied in the
choicest forms of literature; the powerful patriotic
and social influence of the best writers; the educative
quality of the humorous phases of literature; the
great writers as models of skill and enthusiasm in
teaching.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages the significance of literature
among great studies has been but briefly and inadequately
suggested by these few quotations and comments.
It would be easy to multiply similar testimony
from the most competent judges. But enough has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
been said to remind teachers of this rich treasure
house of educative materials. Those teachers who
wish to probe deeper into this subject will find that it
has been handled in a masterly way by some of the
great essayists and critics. We will suggest the following
for more elaborate study:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ruskin's "Sesame and Lilies." The power and
charm of Ruskin's writing appears in full measure in
these essays.</p>

<p>Carlyle's "Heroes and Hero Worship," especially
the chapters on "The Hero as Poet," and "The Hero
as Man of Letters."</p>

<p>Shelley's "Defence of Poetry" (edited by Cook,
and published by Ginn &amp; Co.) is a literary masterpiece
of rare beauty and charm.</p>

<p>Emerson's "Essay on History."</p>

<p>George Willis Cooke, "Poets and Problems"
(Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co.). The first chapter, "The
Poet as Teacher," is very suggestive, while the chapters
on Tennyson, Ruskin, and Browning are fine
introductions for those who will study the authors
themselves.</p>

<p>"The Book Lover," James Baldwin (McClurg &amp;
Co.).</p>

<p>Charles Kingsley's "Literary and General Essays"
(Macmillan &amp; Co.). Chapter on "English Literature,"
and others.</p>

<p>Scudder's "Literature in Schools" (Houghton,
Mifflin, &amp; Co.). Excellent for teachers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>J. C. Shairp, "On Poetic Interpretation of Nature"
(Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co.).</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold's "Sweetness and Light."</p>

<p>Lowell's "Books and Libraries" (Houghton,
Mifflin, &amp; Co.).</p>

<p>Edmund Clarence Stedman's "The Nature and
Elements of Poetry" (Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co.).</p>

<p>It is not implied that even the essays of critics on
the merits of literature can take the place of a study
of the works of the best writers.</p>

<h3>THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES</h3>


<p>With the increasing tendency to consider the
literary quality and fitness of the reading matter used
in our schools, longer poems and stories, like "Snow
Bound," "Rip Van Winkle," "Hiawatha," "Aladdin,"
"The Courtship of Miles Standish," "The
Great Stone Face," and even "Lady of the Lake"
and "Julius C&aelig;sar," are read and studied as complete
wholes. Many of the books now used as readers
are not collections of short selections and extracts,
as formerly, but editions of single poems, or kindred
groups, like "Sohrab and Rustum," or the "Arabian
Nights," or "Gulliver's Travels," or a collection
of a few complete stories or poems of a single author,
as Hawthorne's "Stories of the White Hills," or
Lowell's "Vision of Sir Launfal," and other poems.
Even the regular series of readers are often made up
largely of longer poems and prose masterpieces.</p>

<p>The significance of this change is the deeper regard
which is being paid to good literature as a strong
agency of true culture. The real thought and the
whole thought of the best authors is sought for, presupposing,
of course, that they are within the range<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of the children's comprehension. The reading books
of a generation ago contained oftentimes just as
choice literary materials as now; but the chief purpose
of its selection was to give varied exercise in
oral reading, not to cultivate a taste for good literature
by furnishing complete poetic and prose specimens
for full and enthusiastic study. The teachers
who lay stress on elocutionary skill are not quite
satisfied with this drift toward literary study as such.
It remains to be seen how both aims, good oral rendering
and superior literary training, can be secured
at the same time.</p>

<p>At the close of the last chapter of this volume we
give a carefully selected series of the literary materials
adapted to the different grades. This body
of selections, taken from a wide range of literature,
will constitute a basis for our whole treatise.
Having made plain by our previous discussion what
we understand by the quality of literary masterpieces,
we will next consider why these poems and stories
should be read and studied as complete wholes, not
by fragments or by extracts, but as whole works of
literary art.</p>

<p>1. A stronger interest is developed by the study,
for several weeks, of a longer complete masterpiece.
The interest grows as we move into such a story
or poem as "Sohrab and Rustum." A longer and
closer acquaintance with the characters represented
produces a stronger personal sympathy, as in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
case of Cordelia in "King Lear," or of Silas Marner.
The time usually spent in school upon some classic
fragment or selection is barely sufficient to start up
an interest. It does not bring us past the threshold
of a work of art. We drop it just at the point where
the momentum of interest begins to show itself.
Think of the full story of Aladdin or Crusoe or
Ulysses. Take an extract from "Lady of the
Lake," "Rip Van Winkle," "Evangeline." The
usual three or four pages given in the reader, even
if taken from the first part, would scarcely suffice to
bring the children into the movement of the story;
but oftentimes the fragment is extracted from the
body of the play without preliminary or sequence.
In reading a novel, story, or poem, we do not begin to
feel strongly this interest till two or three chapters are
passed. Then it begins to deepen, the plot thickens,
and a desire springs up to follow out the fortune of
the characters. We become interested in the persons,
and our thoughts are busy with them in the midst of
other employments or in leisure moments. The personality
of the hero takes hold of us as that of an
intimate friend. Such an interest, gradually awakened
and deepened as we move into the comprehension of
a work of art, is the open sesame to all the riches of
an author's storehouse of thought.</p>

<p>This kind of interest presupposes in the children
the ability to appreciate and enjoy the thought, and
even the style, of the author. Interest in this sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is a fundamental test of the suitableness of the story
or poem to lay hold of the inner life of the children.
In many cases there will be difficulties at the outset
in awakening this genuine form of interest, but
if the selection is appropriate, the preparation
and skill of the teacher will be equal to its
accomplishment.</p>

<p>As we get deeper into the study of masterpieces,
we shall discover that there are stronger and deepening
sources of a genuine interest. Even the difficulties
and problems which are supposed to dampen
interest will be found, with proper study, to be the
source of a stronger appreciation and enthusiasm.
The refining and strengthening of these interests in
literature leads on steadily to the final goal of study,
a cultivated taste and habit of using the best books.</p>

<p>2. A complete work of a master writer is a unit
of thought. It is almost as complete a whole as
a living organism. Its parts, like the branches of a
tree, have no vitality except in communication with
the living trunk. In the "Vision of Sir Launfal,"
there is a single thought, like a golden thread, running
through the poem, which gives unity and perfection
to it. The separate parts of the poem have
very great intrinsic beauty and charm, but their
deeper and more vital relation is to this central
thought. The story of "The Great Stone Face" is
the grouping of a series of interesting episodes along
the path of a single developing motive in the life of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Ernest. A great writer would scarcely waste his
time in trying to produce a work of art without a
controlling motive, collecting his thought, as it were,
around a vacuum. This hub-thought must become
the centre of all intelligent study. The effort to
unravel the motive of the author is the deeper stimulus
of thoughtful work by both teacher and pupils.</p>

<p>In other studies, like geography, history, and
natural science, we are gradually picking out the
important units of study, the centres of thought and
interest, the types. This effort to escape from the
wilderness of jumbled and fractional details into the
sunlit region of controlling ideas, is a substantial
sign of progress in the teacher's work. In literature
these units have been already wrought out into perfect
wholes by first-class thinkers.</p>

<p>In the greatest of all studies, the works of the
literary masters, we have the surest models of inspiring
thought, organized and focussed upon essential
topics. Teachers, in some cases, are so little accustomed
to lift their heads above the tall grass and
weeds around them, that they are overtaken by surprise
and bewilderment when called upon to take
broad and liberal surveys of the topography of
school studies.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that we have, within the fenced
boundaries of the commonly recognized school
course, these shining specimens of organized, and,
what we might call, intelligent thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>We can set the children at work digging for the
root-thoughts of those who are the masters of strong
thinking. This digging process is not wholly out
of place with children. Their abundant energy can
be turned to digging if there is anything worth
digging for. Ruskin, in "Sesame and Lilies,"
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And it is just the same with men's best wisdom.
When you come to a good book, you must ask yourself:
'Am I inclined to work as an Australian miner
would? Are my pickaxes and shovels in good
order, and am I in good trim myself, my sleeves well
up to the elbow, and my breath good, and my temper?'
And, keeping the figure a little longer, even
at cost of tiresomeness, for it is a thoroughly useful
one, the metal you are in search of, being the
author's mind or meaning, his words are as the rock
which you have to crush and smelt in order to get
at it. And your pickaxes are your own care, wit
and learning; your smelting furnace is your own
thoughtful soul. Do not hope to get at any good
author's meaning without those tools and that fire;
often you will need sharpest, finest chiselling, and
patientest fusing, before you can gather one grain
of the metal."</p>

<p>It is not the dreamy, hammock-soothing, vacation
idling with pleasant stories that we are now considering.
This happy lotus-land has also its fitting season,
in the sultry heats of summer, when tired people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
put their minds out to grass. Any study will grow
dull and sleepy that lacks energy.</p>

<p>Teachers who shrink back with anxiety lest works
such as Irving's "Sketch Book," "Evangeline,"
"Merchant of Venice," and "Marmion," are too
hard for children in sixth, seventh, and eighth
grades, should consider for a moment what classical
preparatory schools for centuries have required of
boys from ten to twelve years of age, the study of
"C&aelig;sar," "Eutropius," and "Virgil," of "Herodotus"
and "Xenophon," in unknown languages extremely
difficult to master. Yet it has been claimed
for ages, by the best scholars, that this was the true
strength-producing discipline for boys. It would
hardly be extravagant to say that the masterpieces
of literature now used, in our intermediate and grammar
grades, are not a quarter so difficult and four
times as appropriate and interesting as the Latin
and Greek authors just cited. It seems obvious that
we are summoned to a more energetic study and
treatment of our masterpieces.</p>

<p>This struggle to get at the deeper undercurrent
of thought in an author is the true stimulus and discipline
of such studies.</p>

<p>A great author approaches his deeper thought step
by step. He has many side-lights, variety of episode
and preliminary. He provides for the proper scenery
and setting for his thought. He does not bring us
at once, point blank, upon his hero or upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
hero's fate. There is great variety of inference and
suggestion in the preparation and grouping of the
artist's work. As in climbing some mountain peak,
we wind through ca&ntilde;on, along rugged hillsides and
spurs, only now and then catching a glimpse of the
towering object of our climb, reaching, after many a
devious and toilsome march, the rugged backbone
of the giant; so the poet carries us along many a
winding road, through byways and thickets, over
hill and plain, before he brings us into full view of
the main object of search. But after awhile we do
stand face to face with a real character, and are conscious
of the framework upon which it is built. King
Saul has run his course and is about to reap the
reward of his doings, to lie down in the bed which
he has prepared. We see the author's deeper plan,
and realize that his characters act along the line of
the silent but invincible laws of social life and conduct.
These deep significant truths of human experience
do not lie upon the surface. If we are really
to get a deep insight into human character, as portrayed
by the masters, we must not be in haste. We
should be willing to follow our guide patiently and
await results.</p>

<p>A complete masterpiece, studied as a whole, reveals
the author's power. It gives some adequate perception
of his style and compass. A play, a poem, a
novel, a biography, is a unit. No single part can
give a satisfactory idea of the whole. A single scene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
from "Crusoe" or from the "Merchant of Venice"
does not give us the author's meaning. An extract
from one of Burke's speeches supplies no adequate
notion of his statesmanlike grasp of thought. To
get some impression of what Daniel Webster was we
must read a whole speech. A literary product is like
a masterpiece of architecture. The whole must stand
out in the due proportion of its parts to reveal the
master's thought.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Walk about Zion, and go round about her:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell the towers thereof.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye may tell it to the generations following."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To have read through with care and thoughtful
appreciation a single literary masterpiece and to have
felt the full measure of a master's power, is a rare
and lasting stroke of culture. As children move up
through the grades they may receive the strong and
abiding impress of the masters of style. Let it come
to them in its undiminished strength. To feel the
powerful tonic effect of the best stories and poems
suited to their age will give them such an appreciation
of what is genuine and good in literature, that
frivolous and trashy reading is measured at its true
value.</p>

<p>The fragments and extracts with which our higher
readers are filled are not without power and influence
upon culture. They have given many children their
first taste of the beauty and strength of literature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
But it is a great mistake to tear these gems of
thought from their setting in literature and life, and
to jam them into the close and crowded quarters of a
text-book. Why satisfy ourselves with crumbs and
fragments when a full rich feast may be had for the
asking?</p>

<p>In some cases it is said that the reading of fragments
of large poems or plays has excited curiosity
and led to the reading of the larger wholes. This is
doubtless true, but in the greater number of cases
we are inclined to think the habit of being satisfied
with fragments has checked the formation of any
appreciation of literary wholes. This tendency to
be satisfied with piecemeal performances illustrates
painfully the shallowness and incoherency of much
of our educational work. If teachers cannot think
beyond a broken page of Shakespeare, why should
children burden themselves with the labor of thought?
Charles Kingsley, in his essay on English literature,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I must plead for whole works. 'Extracts'
and 'Select Beauties' are about as practical as the
worthy in the old story, who, wishing to sell his house,
brought one of the bricks to market as a specimen.
It is equally unfair on the author and on the pupil;
for it is impossible to show the merits or demerits
of a work of art, even to explain the truth or falsehood
of any particular passage, except by viewing
the book as an organic whole."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>What would the authors themselves say upon seeing
their work thus mutilated? There is even a
touch of the farcical in the effort to read naturally
and forcibly and discuss intelligently a fragment like
Antony's speech over C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>3. The moral effect of a complete masterpiece is
deeper and more permanent. Not only do we see a
person acting in more situations, revealing thus his
motives and hidden springs of action, but the thread
of his thought and life is unravelled in a steady
sequence. Later acts are seen as the result of former
tendencies. The silent reign of moral law in
human actions is discovered. Slowly but surely conduct
works out its own reward along the line of these
deeper principles of action. Even in the books read
in the early grades these profound lessons of life
come out clear and strong. Robinson Crusoe, Theseus,
Siegfried, Hiawatha, Beauty and the Beast,
Jason, King Arthur, and Ulysses are not holiday
guests. They are face to face with the serious
problems of life. Each person is seen in the
present make-up and tendency of his character.
When the eventual wind-up comes, be it a collapse
or an ascension, we see how surely and
fatally such results spring from such motives and
tendencies. Washington is found to be the first in
the hearts of his countrymen; Arnold is execrated;
King Lear moves on blindly to the reward which
his own folly has prearranged; Macbeth entangles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
himself in a network of fatal errors; Adam Bede
emerges from the bitter ordeal of disappointment
with his manly qualities subdued but stronger. Give
the novelist or poet time and opportunity, and he is
the true interpreter of conduct and destiny. He
reveals in real and yet ideal characters the working
out in life of the fundamental principles of moral
action.</p>

<p>4. A classic work is often a picture of an age, a
panoramic survey of an historical epoch. Scott's
"Marmion" is such a graphic and dramatic portrayal
of feudalism in Scotland. The castle with its lord,
attendants, and household, the steep frowning walls
and turrets, the moat, drawbridge, and dungeon, the
chapel, halls, and feastings, the knight clad in armor,
on horseback with squire and troop,&mdash;these are the
details of the first picture. The cloister and nuns,
with their sequestered habits and dress, their devotion
and masses, supply the other characteristic picture of
that age, with Rome in the background. The court
scene and ball in King James's palace, before the
day of Flodden, the view of Scotland's army from
the mountain side, with the motley hordes from highland
and lowland and neighboring isles, and lastly,
the battle of Flodden itself, where wisdom is weighed
and valor put to the final test,&mdash;all these are but
the parts of a well-adjusted picture of life in feudal
times on the Scottish border. There is incidental
to the narrative much vivid description of Scotch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
scenery and geography, of mountain or valley, of
frowning castle or rocky coast, much of Scotch tradition,
custom, superstition, and clannishness. The
scenes in cloister and dungeon and on the battle-field
are more intensely real than historical narratives
can be. While not strict history, this is truer than
history because it brings us closer to the spirit of
that time. Marmion and Douglas stand out more
clear and lifelike than the men of history.</p>

<p>Although feudalism underwent constant changes
and modifications in every country of Europe, it is
still true that "Marmion" is a type of feudal conditions,
not only in Scotland, but in other parts of Europe,
and a full perception of Scott's poem will make one
at home in any part of European history during
feudal times. As a historical picture of life, it is a
key to the spirit and animating ideas that swayed
the Western nations during several centuries. It is
fiction, not history, in the usual sense, and yet it gives
a more real and vivid consciousness of the forces at
work in that age than history proper.</p>

<p>While the plot of the story covers a narrow field,
only a few days of time and a small area of country,
its roots go deep into the whole social, religious, and
political fabric of that time. It touches real history
at a critical point in the relations between England
and Scotland. It is stirred also by the spirit of the
Scotch bard and of minstrelsy. It shows what a
hold Rome had in those days, even in the highlands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Scotland. It is full of Scotch scenery and geography.
It rings with the clarion of war and of battle. It
reveals the contempt in which letters were held
even by the most powerful nobles. Oxen are described
as drawing cannon upon the field of Flodden,
and in time these guns broke down the walls of
feudalism. As a historical picture Marmion is many-sided,
and the roots of the story reach out through
the whole fabric of society, showing how all the parts
cohere. Such a piece of historical literature may
serve as a centre around which to gather much and
varied information through other school and home
readings. Children may find time to read "Ivanhoe,"
"The Crusades," "Roland," "Don Quixote," "The
Golden Legend," "Macbeth," "Goetz von Berlichingen,"
etc. They will have a nucleus upon which
to gather many related facts and ideas. It should
also be brought into proper connection with the
regular lessons in history and geography. History
reveals itself to the poet in these wonderfully vivid
and lifelike types. In many of these historical poems,
as "William Tell," "Evangeline," "Crusoe," "The
Nibelung Song," "Miles Standish," the "Odyssey,"
"Sohrab and Rustum," some hero stands in the centre
of the narrative, and can be understood as a representative
figure of his times only as the whole series
of events in his life is unrolled.</p>

<p>Where the study of larger literary wholes has
been taken up in good faith, it has brought a rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
blessing of intelligent enthusiasm. Even in primary
schools, where literary wholes like "Hiawatha,"
"Robinson Crusoe," and the "Golden Touch" are
handled with a view to exploit their whole content,
there has been a remarkable enrichment of the whole
life of the children. Such a treatment has gone so
deep into the problems and struggling conditions of
life delineated, that the children have become occupied
with the tent-making, boat-building, spinning,
and various constructions incident to the development
of the story.</p>

<p>5. If it is true, as clearly expressed by strong thinkers
in the most various fields of deeper investigation,
that many of the chief literary products that have
come down to us from former ages are the only
means by which we can be brought into vital touch
and sympathy with the spirit and motives then ruling
among men; if it is equally true that children will
not grow up to the proper appreciation and interpretation
of our present life, except as they have experienced,
in thought and interest at least, the chief
struggles and motives of our fathers,&mdash;we may find
in these historic and literary materials the deep and
living springs of true education for children.</p>

<p>The thought of the educative power of this ancestral
literature has been forcibly expressed by many
eminent writers.</p>

<p>Scudder, in "Literature in School," says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is the element of continuity. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Roman household there stood the cinerary urns which
held the ashes of the ancestors of the family. Do
you think the young ever forgot the unbroken line of
descent by which they climbed to the heroic founders
of the state? In the Jewish family the child was
taught to think and speak of the God of Abraham,
and of Isaac, and of Jacob. In that great succession
he heard a voice which told him his nation was not
of a day. It is the business of the old to transmit
to the young the great traditions of the past of
the country; to feed anew the undying flame of
patriotism.</p>

<p>"It is this concentration in poetry and the more
lofty prose which gives to literary art its preciousness
as a symbol of human endeavor, and renders it
the one essential and most serviceable means for
keeping alive the smouldering coals of patriotism.
It is the torch passed from one hand to another, signaling
hope and warning; and the one place above
all others where its light should be kindled is where
the young meet together, in those American temples
which the people have built in every town and village
in the country."</p>

<p>Mabie, in "Books and Culture" (pp. 88, 89-113),
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, it is upon this imperishable food which the
past has stored up through the genius of great artists
that later generations feed and nourish themselves.
It is through intimate contact with these fundamental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
conceptions, worked out with such infinite pain and
patience, that the individual experience is broadened
to include the experience of the race."</p>

<p>"The student of literature, therefore, finds in its
noblest works not only the ultimate results of race
experience and the characteristic quality of race
genius, but the highest activity of the greatest minds
in their happiest and most expansive moments. In
this commingling of the best that is in the race and
the best that is in the individual, lies the mystery of
that double revelation which makes every work of art
a disclosure, not only of the nature of the man
behind it, but of all men behind him. In this commingling,
too, is preserved the most precious deposit
of what the race has been and done, and of what the
man has seen, felt, and known. In the nature of
things no educational material can be richer, none so
fundamentally expansive and illuminative."</p>

<p>Emerson, in his "Essay on History," says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The advancing man discovers how deep a property
he has in literature,&mdash;in all fable as well as in
all history. He finds that the poet was no odd fellow
who described strange and impossible situations, but
that universal man wrote by his pen a confession true
for one and true for all. His own secret biography
he finds in lines wonderfully intelligible to him, dotted
down before he was born. One after another he
comes up in his private adventures with every fable
of &AElig;sop, of Homer, of Hafiz, of Ariosto, of Chaucer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of Scott, and verifies them with his own head and
hands.</p>

<p>"The beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper
creations of the imagination and not of the fancy, are
universal verities. What a range of meanings and
what perpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus!
Besides its primary value as the first chapter
of the history of Europe (the mythology thinly veiling
authentic facts, the invention of the mechanic
arts and the migration of colonies), it gives the history
of religion with some closeness to the faith of
later ages."</p>

<p>"Thus in all ways does the soul concentrate and
reproduce its treasures for each pupil. He, too, shall
pass through the whole cycle of experience. He
shall collect into a focus the rays of nature. History
no longer shall be a dull book. It shall walk incarnate
in every just and wise man. You shall not tell
me by languages and titles a catalogue of the volumes
you have read. You shall make me feel what
periods you have lived. A man shall be the Temple
of Fame. He shall walk, as the poets have described
that goddess, in a robe painted all over with wonderful
events and experiences; his own form and features
by their exalted intelligence shall be that
variegated vest. I shall find in him the Foreworld;
in his childhood the Age of Gold; the Apples of
Knowledge; the Argonautic Expedition; the calling
of Abraham; the building of the Temple; the Ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>vent
of Christ; Dark Ages; the Revival of Letters;
the Reformation; the discovery of new lands; the
opening of new sciences, and new regions in man."</p>

<p>6. It is not intended to limit the reading of the
schools to the longer classics, such as "Snow-Bound,"
"The Vision of Sir Launfal," and Webster's Bunker
Hill speech, etc. There are also many shorter poems
and stories, ballads, and myths, that are equally good
and stand out as strong, complete expressions of
thought such as Tennyson's "Brook," Longfellow's
"Village Blacksmith," Whittier's "Barefoot Boy,"
and many others. These shorter pieces should be interspersed
among the longer, and freely used to give
greater variety and zest to reading exercises. Many
of the finest literary products of the language are
found in these shorter poems and stories. They also
should be studied for the beauty and unity of thought
contained in each.</p>

<p>7. But the <i>sustained power</i> gained from the full and
rich study of longer classics is the best fruitage of
the reading work. Every term of school should
lead the children into the full appreciation of one
or more of these masterly works. The value of
such study is well expressed by Scudder in his
"Literature in Schools" (pp. 54-56):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The real point of practical reform, however, is
not in the preference of American authors to English,
but in the careful concentration of the minds
of boys and girls upon standard American literature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in opposition to a dissipation over a desultory and
mechanical acquaintance with scraps from a variety
of sources, good, bad, and indifferent. In my paper
on 'Nursery Classics in School,' I argued that there
is a true economy in substituting the great books
of that portion of the world's literature which represents
the childhood of the world's mind for the thin,
quickly forgotten, feeble imaginations of insignificant
bookmakers. There is an equally noble economy
in engaging the child's mind, when it is passing out
of an immature state into one of rational, intelligent
appropriation of literature, upon such carefully chosen
classic work as shall invigorate and deepen it. There
is plenty of vagrancy in reading; the public libraries
and cheap papers are abundantly able to satisfy the
truant: but it ought to be recognized once for all
that the schools are to train the mind into appreciation
of literature, not to amuse it with idle diversion;
to this end, the simplest and most direct method
is to place before boys and girls for their regular
task in reading, not scraps from this and that author,
duly paragraphed and numbered, but a wisely selected
series of works by men whom their country honors,
and who have made their country worth living in.</p>

<p>"The continuous reading of a classic is in itself a
liberal education; the fragmentary reading of commonplace
lessons in minor morals, such as make up much
of our reading-books, is a pitiful waste of growing
mental powers. Even were our reading-books com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>posed
of choice selections from the highest literature,
they would still miss the very great advantage which
follows upon the steady growth of acquaintance
with a sustained piece of literary art. I do not
insist, of course, that 'Evangeline' should be read at
one session of the school, though it would be exceedingly
helpful in training the powers of the mind if,
after this poem had been read day by day for a few
weeks, it were to be taken up first in its separate
thirds, and then in an entire reading. What I claim
is that the boy or girl who has read 'Evangeline'
through steadily has acquired a certain power in
appropriating literature which is not to be had by
reading a collection of minor poems,&mdash;the power
of long-sustained attention and interest."</p>

<p>8. The study of literary wholes, whether longer or
shorter, in the common school is based upon the
notion that the full, rich thought of the author is
the absorbing purpose of our effort. Literature is
a reservoir of mental refinement and riches, for the
gaining of which we can afford to sacrifice many
things and make many even good things subordinate.
The words of the wise man in recommending
wisdom to the sons of men are not inappropriate:
"Hear; for I will speak of excellent things and the
opening of my lips shall be right things, and wickedness
is an abomination to my lips. Receive my
instruction and not silver; and knowledge rather
than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and all the things that may be desired are not to be
compared to it."</p>

<p>To get at the wisdom of the best thinkers of the
world, so far as it is accessible to children, is the
straightforward aim of such study. The teachers of
reading, if they but realized it, are the guardians
of a temple more beautiful than the Parthenon in
the days of Pericles, more impressive than the sacred
towers and porticos at Jerusalem; they are the custodians
of a treasure far more rich and lasting than
that in any palace of a king. Such comparisons,
indeed, are almost belittling to the dignity of our
subject. How noble and vast is the temple of
literature! What single mind can grasp its proportions
or the boundless beauty of its decorations?
Moreover, it is a living temple, ever springing up
afresh, in all its pristine strength and beauty, whereever
minds are found reverent, studious, and thoughtful.</p>

<p>9. The old proverb suggests that we "beware of
the man of one book," and is significant of a strong
practical truth. Our modern life demands a somewhat
broader basis of operations than one book can
furnish. But a few of the great books, well mastered,
give the main elements of strength.</p>

<p>Mabie has a short chapter on the "Books of Life"
which "include the original, creative, first-hand books
in all literatures, and constitute in the last analysis
a comparatively small group, with which any student<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
can thoroughly familiarize himself. The literary
impulse of the race has expressed itself in a great
variety of works of varying charm and power, but
the books which are fountain-heads of vitality, ideas,
and beauty are few in number."</p>

<p>The effect upon the teacher of the study of a few
of the "Books of Life" is deserving of emphasis.
First, by limiting the choice to a few things, teachers
are able, without burdening themselves, to penetrate
into the deeper thought and meaning of standard
works which are good specimens and criteria of all
superior literature. Teachers are enabled thus to
become, in a limited way, real students of literature.
It has been observed, not seldom, that teachers of
usual capacity, when turned into a single rich field
like that of "Hiawatha" or the "Merchant of Venice"
or "The Lays of Ancient Rome" or the "Lady of the
Lake," receive an awakening which means much for
their general culture and teaching power. The scattering
of the attention over miscellaneous selections
and fragments can hardly produce this awakening.</p>

<p>Certain difficulties are incident to the reading of
longer works as wholes which it is well to recognize.</p>

<p>1. There is no such nice grading of verbal and
language difficulties as has been wrought out in
some of the standard readers. On this point
Scudder says (p. 41 of "Literature in Schools"):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The drawback to the use of these nursery classics
in the schoolroom undoubtedly has been in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
absence of versions which are intelligible to children
of the proper age, reading by themselves. The
makers of the graded reading-books have expended
all their ingenuity in grading the ascent. They have
been so concerned about the gradual enlargement of
their vocabularies that they have paid slight attention
to the ideas which the words were intended to
convey. But just this gradation may be secured
through the use of these stories, and it only needs
that they should be written out in a form as simple,
especially as regards the order of words, as that
which obtains in the reading-books of equivalent
grade."</p>

<p>But in the longer classics for more advanced
grades there can be no such adaptation, and the
author's form should be retained. The authors of
"Rip Van Winkle" or "Snow-Bound" or "Horatius
at the Bridge" were not trying to phrase their
thought to meet the needs of children, but wrote as
the spirit moved them. The greater vigor and intensity
of the author's style will make up, however, in
large part, for this defect in easy grading. Children
are not so much afraid of big or new words, if there
is attractiveness and power of thought. The larger
richness and variety of language in a fruitful author
is a positive advantage as compared with the leanness
and dulness of many a smoothly graded reading lesson.</p>

<p>2. It is claimed that there is, in some masterpieces,
like "Evangeline" or one of Webster's speeches, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
monotony and tiresome sameness which grows burdensome
to pupils ere the conclusion is reached. At
least there is much less variety in style and thought
than in an equal number of pages in the usual reader.</p>

<p>In some cases there is good ground for this criticism.
It may be a defect in the writer's style, or in
not finding a suitable selection for the class. In
some cases it is due to lack of power in the teacher
to bring the children properly into close contact with
the author's thought.</p>

<p>But dulness and apathy are often found in reading
short selections as well as in longer ones. Generally
speaking, longer pieces are apt to kindle a deeper
and stronger interest. Many of the longer selections
have also great variety of rhetorical style. Dickens's
"Christmas Carol" is employed in one of the drill
books in reading to illustrate all phases of voice and
tone.</p>

<p>3. It is not an unusual experience to find that a
longer story or poem seems too hard for a class, and
it may be impossible to interest them because of
verbal or thought difficulties. But the teacher should
not give up the struggle at once. Often, in a new
author, difficulties that seem at first insurmountable
give way before vigorous effort, and a lively interest
is awakened. This has been noticed in Macaulay's
"Lays of Ancient Rome," in Irving's "Rip Van
Winkle," in Scott's "Lady of the Lake," also in
Webster's "Speech in reply to Hayne." The teacher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
should not depend wholly upon the author's making
himself intelligible and interesting to the children.
His own enthusiasm, clear grasp of thought, suggestive
assignment of lesson, and skill in comment and
question should awaken insight and attention. It is
advisable at times to pass by specially difficult passages,
or leave them for later special study.</p>

<p>4. In some schools it is not possible to secure
books containing the complete classics. But even
the regular readers often contain complete poems
and stories, and several of the large companies are
publishing many of the complete masterpieces in
good print and binding, no more expensive than
the regular readers.</p>

<p>5. The greatest difficulty, after all, is the lack of
experience of many teachers with the longer classics.
In many cases their inability to select what would
suit their classes is a hindrance. But the experience
of many teachers with these materials is rapidly settling
the question as to the place and importance of
the leading masterpieces as well as of many shorter
selections.</p>

<h3>LITERARY MATERIALS FOR THE FIVE UPPER GRADES</h3>


<p>There is great abundance and variety of choice
reading matter suitable for the grades from the fourth
to the eighth inclusive. The best sets of reading-books
have drawn from this rich material, but no
series of readers can compass adequately the field.
Some of the longer classical stories and poems have
been incorporated into readers, but a single set of
readers cannot be made large enough to contain a
quarter of the valuable reading matter which should be
furnished in these grades. The large publishing houses
now supply, at moderate expense, in small and convenient
book form, a great variety of the very best
complete masterpieces. In order to show more clearly
the richness and variety of this material, we will discuss
briefly the principal kinds of reading matter which
are distributed through these five grades. We assume
that during the first three years of school life children
have learned how to read, having mastered the
forms and symbols of printed language. At the
beginning of the fourth grade, therefore, they are
prepared to read some of those choice literary products
which constitute a part of the permanent lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>erature
of the world. After having collected and
arranged these products, we find that they fall into
several distinctly marked classes.</p>


<p>1. The Myths.</p>

<p>These include such stories as Hawthorne's "Wonder
Book" and "Tanglewood Tales," Peabody's "Old
Greek Folk Stories," Kingsley's "Greek Heroes,"
"The Story of Ulysses," Bryant's translation of
the "Iliad" and "Odyssey," Pope's "Homer," and
many other prose and poetic renderings of the Greek
myths.</p>

<p>Another group of myths include Mabie's "Norse
Stories," "Heroes of Asgard," "Siegfried," "Myths
of Northern Lands," Skinner's "Readings in Folk
Lore," and many forms of the Norse myths. The
story of "Hiawatha" belongs also to this group,
while some of the earlier English and Roman myths
belong to the same class.</p>

<p>The choicest of these mythical stories are distributed
as reading matter through the fourth and
fifth grades. They constitute a large share of the
most famous literature of the great civilized nations.
It is worth while to name over the virtues of these
stories and poems.</p>

<p>They have sprung directly out of the people's
life, they are race products, worked over from age
to age by poetic spirits, and finally gathered into
enduring form by a Homer, Virgil, or Spenser.
The best of our later poets and prose masters have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
employed their finest skill in rendering them into
simple and poetic English, as Bryant, Kingsley,
Longfellow, Pope, Hawthorne, Palmer, Tennyson,
Church, and many more.</p>

<p>They are the best descriptions we have of the
customs, ideas, and dress, the homes, habits, and motives,
of the ancestral races. Many other sources,
as temples, ruins, tombs, coins, etc., help to explain
this early history; but this literature calls it again
into life and puts meaning into all other sources of
knowledge.</p>

<p>The influence which this early literature has had
upon later historical growth of the great races is
overwhelming, and is plain to the eyes of even unscholarly
persons. The root from which the marvellous
tree of Greek civilization grew is seen in Homer's
poems.</p>

<p>In these myths we find those commanding characters
which typify the strength and virtues of the
race, as Achilles, Ulysses, Siegfried, Penelope, Thor,
Apollo, Theseus, Hiawatha, Orpheus, Diana, Vulcan,
Prometheus, and the Muses.</p>

<p>A close acquaintance with these creative ideas of
the early world is necessary to an understanding
of all subsequent life and literature. And it is not
merely the names of Greek divinities and definitions
of their character and qualities which put meaning
into the numberless allusions of modern writers. One
reason why many modern thinkers smile at the trite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ness
and childishness of Greek fable is, that they
have not caught the spirit and meaning of the Greek
story. The great masters of thought, like Goethe,
Shakespeare, Emerson, Tennyson, and Bryant, have
seen deeper.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, in childhood, during the early school
years especially, that we may best appreciate and
enjoy these poetic creations of an early world. It is
hardly to be expected that people whose youth has
been clamped into the mould of commonplace and
sensuous facts, and whose later years have been
crusted over with modern materialism and commercialism,
should listen with any patience to Orpheus
and the Muses, or even to the wood notes of Pan.</p>

<p>We hardly need to dwell upon the idea that the
old heroic myths are the delight of boys and girls,
and that this sympathy for the myth is the foundation
of its educative power. Nor is it the purpose of
the school to warp the minds of children into this one
channel of growth. The historical and scientific
studies run parallel with the myth, and give strength
for realities.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see that music, the drama, and
the fine arts spring from these old myths as from
their chief source. They furnish motive to many of
the greatest works of dramatist, composer, painter,
and sculptor, in all the ages since. &AElig;schylus and
the Greek dramatists, Goethe and Wagner, F&eacute;nelon
and Shakespeare, drew abundantly from these sources.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>A few of the striking characters of this great age
of heroic myths should be treated with such fulness
as to stand out clearly to the children and appeal to
the heart as well as to the head. Ulysses and Siegfried
stand in the centre of two of the chief stories,
and exemplify great qualities of character, strength,
wisdom, and nobleness of mind.</p>

<p>In the third grade the children have had an oral
introduction to some of the old stories, and have had
a spirited entrance to Mythland. This oral treatment
of the stories is a fitting and necessary prelude
to the reading work of the fourth and fifth grades.
It is more fully discussed, together with the art of
the story-teller, in "The Special Method in Primary
Reading and Story."</p>

<p>Closely related to the myths, and kindred in spirit,
are such choice reading materials as "The Arabian
Nights," "King of the Golden River," Stockton's
"Fanciful Tales," "The Pied Piper," and a number
of shorter poems and stories found in the collections
recommended for fourth and fifth grades. Some of
Hawthorne's and Irving's stories belong also to this
group.</p>


<p>2. Ballads and Traditional Stories.</p>

<p>A somewhat distinct group of the best reading for
fourth and fifth grades is found in the historical
ballads and national legends from the early history
of England, Germany, Italy, and France. They include
such selections as "Sir Patrick Spens," "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Ballads of Robin Hood," "Horatius," "Bannock-burn,"
"The Heart of the Bruce," "The Story of
Regulus," of "Cincinnatus," "Alfred the Harper,"
and many more. In the list of books recommended
for children's reading are several ballad books,
Macaulay's "Lays of Ancient Rome," "The Book of
Golden Deeds," "Tales from English History," and
several others, with great variety of poem and story.
Many of these selections are short and spirited and
well suited to awaken the strongest enthusiasm of
children. They are sometimes in dialogue form,
both in prose and verse, have strong dramatic
action, and are thus helpful in variety and force of
expression. There is also much early history and
national spirit involved. The old historical ballads
and traditions have great educative value. They are
simple, crude, and powerful, and awaken the spirit to
receive the message of heroism. In her introduction
to the "Ballad Book," Katharine Lee Bates says,
"For these primitive folk-songs, which have done
so much to educate the poetic sense in the fine
peasantry of Scotland&mdash;that peasantry which has
produced an Ayreshire Ploughman and an Ettric
Shepherd&mdash;are assuredly,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Thanks to the human heart by which it lives,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">among the best educators that can be brought into
our schoolrooms."</p>

<p>"The Lays of Ancient Rome," the "Ballads," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the "Tales from English History" belong to the
heroic series. Though far separated in time and
place, they breathe the same spirit of personal energy,
self-sacrifice, and love of country. They reveal
manly resistance to cruelty and tyranny. We may
begin this series with a term's work upon Macaulay's
"Lays" and a few other choice stories in prose and
verse. Thereafter we may insert other ballads,
where needed, in connection with history, and in
amplification of longer stories or masterpieces like
Scott's "Tales of a Grandfather," and "Marmion."
In the fifth grade, children are of an age when these
stories of heroism in olden days strike a responsive
chord. They delight in such tales, memorize them,
and enter into the full energy of their spirited reproduction.
The main purpose at first is to appreciate
their thought as an expression of history,
tradition, and national life. A complete and absorbing
study of a single series of these ballads, as of
Macaulay's, supplies also an excellent standard of
comparison for other more or less similar episodes
in the history of Switzerland, Greece, England, and
America.</p>

<p>These historical legends merge almost imperceptibly
into the historical tales of early English,
Roman, and French or German history. The patriarchal
stories of the Old Testament furnish the
finest of early history stories and should be included
in these materials. "The Old Stories of the East,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and "Old Testament Stories in Scripture Language"
are among the best.</p>


<p>3. Stories of Chivalry.</p>

<p>Tales of chivalry, beginning with "Arthur and his
Round Table Knights," "Roland and Oliver," and
other medi&aelig;val tales, have a great attraction for poets
and children. Such books are included in our lists as
"The Court of King Arthur," the "Story of Roland,"
"Tales of Chivalry," "The Boys' King Arthur," the
"Age of Chivalry," and "The Coming of Arthur" and
"Passing of Arthur." There are also many shorter
poems touching this spirit of chivalry in the Ballad
literature. The character and spirit of King Arthur
as revealed in the matchless music of Tennyson
should find its way to the hearts of children before
they leave the school. Like Sir Galahad, he could
say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My strength is as the strength of ten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because my heart is pure."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>4. Historical Stories and Poems.</p>

<p>In the fifth and sixth grades children should begin
to read some of the best biographical and historical
stories of America and of European countries. Of
these we have excellent materials from many lands
and periods of time, such as Higginson's "American
Explorers," Morris's "Historical Tales" (both American
and English), "Stories of American Life and
Adventure," "Stories of Our Country," "Pioneer History
Stories," "Ten Boys on the Road from Long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Ago," "The Story of the English," "Stories from
Herodotus," "Pilgrims and Puritans," Hawthorne's
"Biographical Stories," "Stories from American
Life," and others.</p>

<p>In the oral history lessons given on alternate days
in fourth grade (see special method in history) we
have made a spirited entrance to American history
through the pioneer stories of the Mississippi Valley.
These should precede and pave the way for classic
readings in American history. In the fifth grade,
the stories of Columbus and of the chief navigators,
also the narratives of the Atlantic coast pioneers, are
told. The regular history work of the sixth grade
should be a study of the growth of the leading
colonies during the colonial period and the French
and Indian Wars.</p>

<p>In the fifth grade we may begin to read some of
the hero narratives of our own pioneer epoch as
rendered by the best writers; for instance, Higginson's
"American Explorers," "Pilgrims and Puritans,"
"Stories of Our Country," and "Grandfather's
Chair." They are lifelike and spirited, and introduce
us to the realism of our early history in its
rugged exposure and trials, while they bring out those
stern but high ideals of life which the Puritan and
the Cavalier, the navigator, the pioneer hunter, and
explorer illustrate. Higginson's collection of letters
and reports of the early explorers, with their quaint
language and eye-witness descriptions, is strikingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
vivid in its portraiture of early scenes upon our
shores. Hawthorne, in "Grandfather's Chair," has
moulded the hardy biography of New England leaders
into literary form.</p>


<p>5. Great Biographies.</p>

<p>In addition to the shorter biographical stories just
mentioned, as children advance into the sixth, seventh,
and eighth grades, they should make a close acquaintance
with a few of the great biographies. There is
an abundance of excellent American biographies, but
we should limit ourselves to those most important
and best suited to influence the character of young
people. It is necessary also to use those which have
been written in a style easily comprehended by the
children. Some of the best are as follows: Scudder's
"Life of Washington," Franklin's "Autobiography,"
Hosmer's "Life of Samuel Adams," and the lives
of John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, and Lincoln
in the "Statesman Series." There are two
fairly good books of Lincoln's early life for children.
There are also many shorter biographies included
in the books recommended for regular or collateral
reading.</p>

<p>In style and content the story of Franklin is
one of the best for children. The "Autobiography"
of Franklin has many graphic touches
from American life. His intense practical personality,
his many-sidedness and public spirit, make
up a character that will long instruct and open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
out in many directions the minds of the young.
His clear sense and wisdom in small affairs as in
great, and the pleasing style of his narrative, are
sufficiently characteristic to have a strong personal
impression. It will hardly be necessary to take the
whole of the "Autobiography," but the more attractive
parts, leaving the rest to the private reading of
children. "Poor Richard's Almanac" intensifies the
notion of Franklin's practical and everyday wisdom,
and at the same time introduces the children to a
form of literature that, in colonial days, under
Franklin's patronage, had a wide acceptance and
lasting influence in America.</p>

<p>Plutarch's "Lives" furnish a series of great biographies
which grammar school children should
become well acquainted with. The lives of American
writers and poets should be brought to the attention
of children in conjunction with their productions.
"The Children's Stories of American Literature"
and the introductory chapters of many of the masterpieces
furnish this interesting and stimulating
material. It should not be neglected by pupils and
teachers. For older pupils and for teachers several
of Macaulay's "Essays" are valuable, and the style
is strikingly interesting. For example, the essays on
Samuel Johnson, Lord Chatham, Milton, Addison,
and Frederick the Great. Motley's "Essay on Peter
the Great" and Carlyle's "Essay on Burns" are of
similar interest and value. "The Sch&ouml;nberg Cotta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Family" is valuable in the upper grammar grades.
Most of this kind of reading must be outside reference
work if it is done at all. Teachers should, first
of all, enrich their own experience by these readings,
occasionally bring a book to the class from
which selections may be read, and, secondly, encourage
the more enthusiastic and capable children to
this wider field of reading.</p>


<p>6. Historical Poems and Pictures of American
Life.</p>

<p>Some of the best American poems and prose
masterpieces are fine descriptions of American life
and manners, in different parts of the country and
at various times. Such are: "Courtship of Miles
Standish," "Tales of the White Hills," "Snow-Bound,"
"Rip Van Winkle," and "Sleepy Hollow."
"The Gentle Boy," "Mabel Martin," "Giles Corey,"
"Evangeline," "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and some of
the great biographies, like those of Samuel Adams,
Franklin, Washington, and Lincoln, are also fine
descriptions of home life in America. The same
may be said of some of the masterpieces of English
and European literature, for example, "Ivanhoe,"
"Roger de Coverley," "The Christmas Carol,"
"Vicar of Wakefield," "William Tell," "Silas Marner,"
"The Cotter's Saturday Night," and "Sch&ouml;nberg
Cotta Family."</p>

<p>The culture value of these pictures of home and
domestic life for young people is surpassingly great.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Gradually their views are broadened, and they may
be imbued with those social, home-bred qualities and
virtues so fundamental in human life.</p>

<p>Irving's stories and Longfellow's "Miles Standish"
give a still more pronounced and pleasing
literary cast to two of the characteristic forms of
life in our colonial history, the Puritan and the
Dutch Patroon. If the children have reached this
point, where they can read and enjoy the "Sketch-Book,"
it will be worth much as a description of life
along the Hudson, and will develop taste and appreciation
for literary excellence. Even the fanciful
and ridiculous elements conduce to mental health
and soundness, by showing up in pleasing satire the
weaknesses and foibles of well-meaning people.</p>

<p>"Snow-Bound," "Songs of Labor," and "Among
the Hills," while not historical in the usual sense,
are still plainly American, and may well be associated
with other poetic delineations of American
life. "Snow-Bound" is a picture of New England
life, with its pleasing and deep-rooted memories. Its
family spirit and idealization of common objects and
joys make it a classic which reaches the hearts of
boys and girls. "Among the Hills" is also a picture
of home life in New England mountains, a contrast
of the mean and low in home environment to
the beauty of thrift and taste and unselfish home
joys. The "Songs of Labor" are descriptive of the
toils and spirit of our varied employments in New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
England and of that larger New England which the
migrating Yankees have established between the
oceans.</p>

<p>"Evangeline" is another literary pearl that enshrines
in sad and mournful measures a story of
colonial days, and teaches several great lessons, as
of the harshness and injustice of war, of fair-mindedness
and sympathy for those of alien speech and
country, of patience and gentleness and loyalty to
high ideals in a character familiar and sacred to all.</p>


<p>7. The Poetry of Nature in the Masterpieces of
Literature.</p>

<p>Both in poetic and in prose form there is great
variety and depth of nature worship in good literature.
There are few, if any, of the great poets who
have not been enthusiastic and sympathetic observers
of nature,&mdash;nature lovers, we may call them. We
can hardly mention the names of Emerson, Bryant,
and Wordsworth, without thinking of their loving
companionship with nature, their flight to the woods
and fields. But the same is true of Lowell, Whittier,
Hawthorne, Whitman, and all the rest. When we
add to these, those companions of nature, such as
Thoreau, Leander Keyser, Olive Thorn Miller, Burroughs,
Warner, and others of like spirit, we may
be surprised at the number of our leading writers
who have found their chief delight in dwelling close
to the heart of nature.</p>

<p>An examination of the books recommended for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
children's study and delight will reveal a large number
of the most graceful, inspiriting products of
human thought, which are nature poems, nature
hymns, odes to skylark, the dandelion, the mountain
daisy, communings with the myriad moods and
forms of the natural world. Such books as "Nature
Pictures by American Poets," "Golden Treasury of
Songs and Lyrics," "Poetry of the Seasons," the
"Open Sesame" books, and others, show an infinite
variety of poetic inspiration from nature. Adding
to these Burroughs's "Birds and Bees," "Wake
Robin," "Squirrels and other Fur-bearers"; Thoreau's
"Succession of Forest Trees"; Higginson's
"Outdoor Papers"; Keyser's "News from the
Birds," "In Bird Land," and "Birddom"; Torrey's
"Footpath Way," and "Birds in the Bush"; Long's
"Wilderness Ways," and "Ways of Wood Folk";
the "Plant World" of Vincent, the "Natural History"
of Selborne, and others of like quality,&mdash;and
we have an abundance of the most friendly and enticing
invitations to nature study. These materials
are suited, by proper arrangement, to all the grades
from the fourth up. Under good teachers such
books can do no other than awaken and encourage
the happiest kind of observation and sympathy for
nature. It is the kind of appreciation of birds and
trees, insects and clouds, which at once trains to
close and discriminating perception, and to the cultivation
of &aelig;sthetic sense in color, form, and sound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The love of nature cannot be better instilled than
by following these poets.</p>

<p>While the study of literature as it images nature
cannot take the place of pure science, it is the most
powerful ally that the scientist can call in. The
poets can do as much to idealize science study, to
wake the dull eye, and quicken the languid interest
in nature, as scientists themselves. Away, then,
with this presumed antagonism between literature
and science! Neither is complete without the other.
Neither can stand on its own feet. But together, in
mutual support, they cannot be tripped up. The
facts, the laws, the utilities, adaptations, and wonders
in nature are not so marvellous but the poet's eye
will pierce beneath and above them, will give them
a deeper interpretation, and clothe them in a garment
of beauty and praise. There is nothing beautiful
or grand or praiseworthy that the poet's eye
will not detect it, and the poet's art reveal it in
living and lasting forms. Let the scientist delve
and the poet sing. The messages between them
should be only those of cheer.</p>

<p>It is in this myriad-voiced world of fields and
brooks, of mountain, lake, and river, of storm and
cloud and of the changing seasons, that poets find
the images, suggestions, and analogies which interpret
and illustrate the spiritual life of man. The
more rigid study of science in laboratory and class-room
is necessary to the student, but it would be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
narrow and pedantic teacher who would not welcome
the poetic temper and enthusiasm in nature study.</p>

<p>The teachers of reading have, therefore, the best
of all opportunities for cultivating this many-sided
sympathy for and insight into nature, and at the
same time to train the children to correlate these
nature poems with their science studies. Observers
like Thoreau and Burroughs give us the greatest
inducement for getting out into the woods. They
open our eyes to the beauties and our hearts to the
truth of nature's teachings. These are the gardens
of delight where science and poetry walk hand in
hand and speak face to face. It would not be difficult
to show that many of the greatest scientists
were poets, and that some of the chiefest poets have
been foremost in scientific study.</p>


<p>8. The Sentiment of Patriotism in Literature.</p>

<p>The powerful national spirit finds expression in
many forms of literature, in hymns, in war song, in
oration, in essay, in pioneer narrative, in stories of battle,
in novel, in flag song, in ballad, and in biography.</p>

<p>We have already noted the great significance of
American history stories in fourth and fifth grades.
It is from the early pioneer epoch and the colonial
history that we derive much of our best educative
history. The heroism of these old days has been
commemorated in story and poem by our best writers.</p>

<p>As we approach the Revolutionary crisis a new body
of choice literary products, aglow with the fire of patri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>otism
and independence, is found stored up for the joy
and stimulus of our growing young Americans: "Paul
Revere's Ride," "Grandmother's Story of Bunker
Hill," Washington's letters, "A Ballad of the Boston
Tea Party," "Ode for Washington's Birthday," "Lexington"
(Holmes), "The Song of Marion's Men,"
"The Green Mountain Boys," Webster's speeches
at Bunker Hill and on Adams and Jefferson, "Old
Ticonderoga" (Hawthorne), Burke's speech on the
American War, Washington's "Farewell to the
Army," The Declaration of Independence, "Under
the Old Elm," and descriptions of some of the great
scenes of the war by our best historians.</p>

<p>It is to be desired that children in the seventh
grade may have opportunity in regular history lessons
to study in detail a few of the central topics of the
Revolutionary epoch. This will put them in touch
with the spirit and surroundings of the Americans.</p>

<p>In the reading lessons of the same grade we may
well afford to discover and feel what our best patriots
and men of letters have said and felt in view of the
struggle for freedom. The noblest expressions of
sentiment upon great men and their achievements
are contagious with the young. Patriotism can find
no better soil in which to strike its deepest roots than
the noble outbursts of our orators and poets and
patriotic statesmen. The cumulative effect of these
varied but kindred materials is greater than when
scattered and disconnected. They mutually support<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
each other, and when they are brought into close
dependence upon parallel historical studies, we may
well say that the children are drinking from the deep
and pure sources of true Americanism.</p>

<p>Parallel to whatever history we attempt to teach in
the eighth grade should run a selection of the best
literary products that our American authors can
furnish, and here again we are rich in resources.
The thought and life of our people find their high-water
mark in the poet's clarion note and the statesman's
impassioned appeal. No others have perceived
the destiny of our young republic as our cherished
poets, Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant, Holmes, and
Emerson. They have stood upon the mountain tops,
looking far and wide through the clear atmosphere,
while the great army of the people has been tenting
in the valleys below. These wakeful priests and
prophets have caught the bright tints of the morning
while the people were still asleep, and have witnessed
the suffused glory of the sunset clouds when the
weary masses below had already forgotten the day's
toil. One thing at least, and that the greatest, can be
done for our children before they finish the common
school course. They may rise into this pure atmosphere
of poet, patriot, sage, and prophet. They may
hear these deathless strains and feel the thrill of these
clarion notes. Let their ears be once attuned to the
strength and harmony of this music, and it will not
cease to echo in their deeper life. The future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
patriots will be at hand, and the coming years will see
them rising to the great duties that inevitably await
them. We have a body of noble, patriotic material
which is capable of producing this effect if handled
by skilful teachers: the Ordinance of 1787, <i>The
Federalist</i>, Numbers 1 and 2, Washington's "Inaugurals"
and the "Farewell Address," Everett's
"Oration on Washington," "O Mother of Mighty
Race" (Bryant); "Our Country's Call" (Bryant);
"Abraham Lincoln" (Bryant); Lincoln's "Inaugurals"
and "Gettysburg Speech," "Army Hymn" and
"The Flower of Liberty" (Holmes), Webster's "Second
Speech on Foot's Resolution," The Emancipation
Proclamation, "The Fortune of the Republic"
(Emerson), etc., "Antiquity of Freedom" (Bryant);
"Centennial Hymn" (Whittier); "The Building of
the Ship" (Longfellow); "The Poor Voter on Election
Day" (Whittier).</p>

<p>Why not gather together these sources of power,
of unselfish patriotism, of self-sacrifice, of noble and
inspiring impulse? Let this fruit-bringing seed be
sown deep in the minds and hearts of the receptive
young. What has inspired the best of men to high
thinking and living can touch them.</p>

<p>It is not by reading and declaiming a few miscellaneous
fragments of patriotic gush, not by waving
flags and banners and following processions, that the
deeper sentiments of patriotism and humanity are to
be touched, but by gathering and concentrating these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
fuller, richer sources of spiritual power and conscious
national destiny. The schoolroom is by far the best
place to consolidate these purifying and conserving
sentiments. By gathering into a rising series and
focussing in the higher grades the various forms, in
prose and verse, in which the genius of our country
has found its strongest expression; by associating
these ringing sentiments with the epochs and crises
of our history, with the valorous deeds of patriots
upon the field and of statesmen in the senate, with
the life and longings of home-nurtured poets and
sages,&mdash;we shall plant seed whose fruitage will not
disappoint the lovers of the fatherland.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace E. Scudder, in his two essays on
"Literature" and "American Classics in the Common
School," has portrayed with convincing clearness the
spiritual power and high-toned Americanism which
breathe from those literary monuments which have
been quarried from our own hillsides and chiselled by
American hands. We recommend to every teacher
the reading in full of these essays, from which we
quote at much length:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fifty years ago there were living in America six
men of mark, of whom the youngest was then nineteen
years of age, the oldest forty-four. Three of
the six are in their graves and three still breathe the
kindly air. [Since this was written, in 1888, the last
of the six has passed away.] One only of the six
has held high place in the national councils, and it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
not by that distinction that he is known and loved.
They have not been in battle; they have had no
armies at their command; they have not amassed
great fortunes, nor have great industries waited on
their movements. Those pageants of circumstances
which kindle the imagination have been remote from
their names. They were born on American soil;
they have breathed American air; they were nurtured
on American ideas. They are Americans of Americans.
They are as truly the issue of our national
life as are the common schools in which we glory.
During the fifty years in which our common school
system has been growing up to maturity these six
have lived and sung; and I dare say that the lives
and songs of Bryant, Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier,
Holmes, and Lowell have an imperishable value,
regarded as exponents of national life, not for a
moment to be outweighed in the balance by the most
elaborate system of common schools which the wit of
man may devise. The nation may command armies
and schools to rise from the soil, but it cannot call
into life a poet. Yet when the poet comes and we
hear his voice in the upper air, then we know the
nation he owns is worthy of the name. Do men
gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so,
pure poetry springs from no rank soil of national
life.</p>

<p>"I am not arguing for the critical study of our
great authors, in the higher grades of our schools.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
They are not the best subjects for critical scholarship;
criticism demands greater remoteness, greater
foreignness of nature. Moreover, critical study is
not the surest method of securing the full measure
of spiritual light, though it yields abundant gain in
the refinement of the intellectual nature and in the
quickening of the perceptive faculties. I am arguing
for the free, generous use of these authors in the
principal years of school life. It is then that their
power is most profoundly needed, and will be most
strongly felt. We need to put our children in their
impressionable years into instant and close connection
with the highest manifestation of our national
life. Away with the bottle and the tube! Give
them a lusty draft at the mother's full breast!</p>

<p>"Nor do I fear that such a course will breed a
narrow and parochial Americanism. On the contrary,
it would destroy a vulgar pride in country,
help the young to see humanity from the heights
on which the masters of song have dwelt, and open
the mind to the more hospitable entertainment of
the best literature of every clime and age. I am
convinced that there is no surer way to introduce
the best English literature into our schools than to
give the place of honor to American literature. In
the order of nature a youth must be a citizen of his
own country before he can become naturalized in the
world. We recognize this in our geography and history;
we may wisely recognize it also in our reading.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"The place, then, of literature in our common
school education is in spiritualizing life, letting light
into the mind, inspiring and feeding the higher forces
of human nature.</p>

<p>"It is the business of the old to transmit to the
young the great traditions of the past of the country,
to feed anew the undying flame of patriotism. There
is the element of destiny. No nation lives upon its
past; it is already dead when it says, 'Let us eat and
drink to-day; for to-morrow we die.' But what that
destiny is to be may be read in the ideals which the
young are forming; and those ideals, again, it is
the business of the old to guide. They cannot form
them; the young must form them for themselves;
but whether these ideals shall be large or petty,
honorable or mean, will depend upon the sustenance
on which they are fed.</p>

<p>"Now in a democracy, more signally than under
any other form of national organization, it is vitally necessary
that there should be an unceasing, unimpeded
circulation of the spiritual life of the people. The
sacrifice of the men and women who have made
and preserved America, from the days of Virginia
and New England to this hour, has been ascending
from the earth in a never-ending cloud; they have
fallen again in strains of music, in sculpture, in
painting, in memorial hall, in tale, in oration, in
poem, in consecration of life; and the spirit which
ascended is the same as that which descended. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
literature above all is this spirit enshrined. You
have but to throw open the shrine, and the spirit
comes with its outspread blessings upon millions of
waiting souls. Entering them, it reissues in countless
shapes, and thus is the life of the nation in its
highest form kept ever in motion, and without motion
is no life.</p>

<p>"The deposit of nationality is in laws, institutions,
art, character, and religion; but laws, institutions,
character, and religion are expressed through art
and mainly through the art of letters. It is literature,
therefore, that holds in precipitation the genius
of the country; and the higher the form of literature,
the more consummate the expression of that spirit
which does not so much seek a materialization as
it shapes itself inevitably in fitting form. Long may
we read and ponder the life of Washington, yet at
last fall back content upon those graphic lines of
Lowell in 'Under the Old Elm,' which cause the
figure of the great American to outline itself upon
the imagination with large and strong portraiture.
The spirit of the orations of Webster and Benton,
the whole history of the young giant poised in conscious
strength before his triumphant struggle, one
may catch in a breath in those glowing lines which end
'The Building of the Ship.' The deep passion of the
war for the Union may be overlooked in some formal
study of battles and campaigns, but rises pure, strong,
and flaming in the immortal 'Gettysburg Speech.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Precisely thus the sentiment of patriotism must
be kept fresh and living in the hearts of the young
through quick and immediate contact with the
sources of that sentiment; and the most helpful
means are those spiritual deposits of patriotism
which we find in noble poetry and lofty prose, as
communicated by men who have lived patriotic lives
and been fed with coals from the altar.</p>

<p>"It is from the men and women bred on American
soil that the fittest words come for the spiritual enrichment
of American youth. I believe heartily in
the advantage of enlarging one's horizon by taking
in other climes and other ages, but first let us make
sure of that great expansive power which lies close
at hand. I am sure there never was a time or country
where national education, under the guidance
of national art and thought, was so possible as in
America to-day.</p>

<p>"The body of wholesome, strong American literature
is large enough to make it possible to keep boys
and girls upon it from the time when they begin to
recognize the element of authorship until they leave
the school, and it is varied and flexible enough to
give employment to the mind in all its stages of
development. Moreover, this literature is interesting,
and is allied with interesting concerns; half the
hard places are overcome by the willing mind, and
the boy who stumbles over some jejune lesson in his
reading-book will run over a bit of genuine prose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
from Irving which the schoolbook maker, with his
calipers, pronounces too hard.</p>

<p>"We have gone quite far enough in the mechanical
development of the common school system.
What we most need is the breath of life, and reading
offers the noblest means for receiving and imparting
this breath of life. The spiritual element in education
in our common schools will be found to lie in
reserve in literature, and, as I believe, most effectively
in American literature.</p>

<p>"Think for a moment of that great, silent, resistless
power for good which might at this moment be
lifting the youth of the country, were the hours for
reading in school expended upon the undying, life-giving
books! Think of the substantial growth of
a generous Americanism, were the boys and girls
to be fed from the fresh springs of American literature!
It would be no narrow provincialism into
which they would emerge. The windows in Longfellow's
mind looked to the east, and the children
who have entered into possession of his wealth travel
far. Bryant's flight carries one through upper air,
over broad champaigns. The lover of Emerson has
learned to get a remote vision. The companion of
Thoreau finds Concord become suddenly the centre
of a very wide horizon. Irving has annexed Spain
to America. Hawthorne has nationalized the gods
of Greece and given an atmosphere to New England.
Whittier has translated the Hebrew Scriptures into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the American dialect. Lowell gives the American
boy an academy without cutting down a stick of
timber in the grove, or disturbing the birds. Holmes
supplies that hickory which makes one careless
of the crackling of thorns. Franklin makes the
America of a past generation a part of the great
world before treaties had bound the floating states
into formal connection with venerable nations.
What is all this but saying that the rich inheritance
we have is no local ten-acre lot, but a part of the
undivided estate of humanity. Universality, Cosmopolitanism,&mdash;these
are fine words, but no man ever
secured the freedom of the Universe who did not
first pay taxes and vote in his own village."&mdash;"Literature
in School" (Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co.).</p>


<p>9. The series of American classics is nowise confined
to the ideas of local or national patriotism, but
above and beyond that deep and powerful sentiment
which magnifies the opportunity and manifest destiny
of our nation, it grasps at the ideal form and content
of those Christian virtues which now and evermore
carry healing and comfort to the toiling millions.
Our poets, as they have pondered on the past and
looked into the future, were not able to be content
with less than the best. As the vision of the coming
years unrolled itself before them they looked
upon it with joy mingled with solicitude. In the
mighty conflicts now upon us only those of generous
and saintly purpose and of pure hearts can prevail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Brief is the time, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warfare scarce begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all may win the triumphs thou hast won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still flows the fount whose waters strengthened thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victors' names are yet too few to fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's mighty roll; the glorious armory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ministered to thee is open still."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bryant.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To reveal this Christian armory, the defences of
the soul against the assaults of evil, has been the
highest inspiration of our poets. What depth and
beauty and impersonation of Christian virtues do we
find in "Snow-Bound," "Among the Hills," "Evangeline,"
"The Conqueror's Grave," "To a Waterfowl,"
"The Groves were God's First Temples," "The Living
Temple," "The Sun Day Hymn," "The Chambered
Nautilus," "Vision of Sir Launfal," "The
Great Stone Face."</p>

<p>The Bible is not generally admissible as a schoolbook,
but the spirit of Christianity, clad in the forms
of strength and grace, is immanent in the works of
our poets. So universal, so human, so fit to the
needs and destinies of men, are the truths of the
great evangel, that the prophets and seers of our
race drift evermore into the sheltering haven they
supply. To drink in these potent truths through
poetry and song, to see them enshrined in the imagery
and fervor of the sacred masterpieces of our
literature, is more than culture, more than morality;
it is the portal and sanctuary of religious thought,
and children may enter it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>10. The higher products of literature contain an
energy that quickens spiritual life in morals, in art,
and in religion. To many people, whose lives are
submerged in commercial pursuits or in the great
struggle to develop and utilize the material resources
of the world, these spiritual forces seem vague and
shadowy, if not mythical. But there are plenty of
heroic souls in the realm of letters, such as Emerson,
Scudder, Ruskin, Arnold, and Carlyle, who are not
disposed to let men settle down in lazy satisfaction
with material good, nor to be blinded even by the
splendor of modern achievements in engineering,
in medicine, and in the application of electricity.
We must at least reach a point of view high enough
to perceive the relations of these natural riches to
the higher nature and destiny of man.</p>

<p>Scudder says, "It is to literature that we must
look for the substantial protection of the growing
mind against an ignoble, material conception of life,
and for the inspiring power which shall lift the
nature into its rightful fellowship with whatsoever
is noble, true, lovely, and of good report."</p>

<p>Shelley, in like spirit, says: "The cultivation of
poetry is never more to be desired than at periods
when, from an excess of the selfish and calculating
principle, the accumulation of the materials of external
life exceed the quantity of the power of assimilating
them to the internal laws of human nature.
The body has then become too unwieldy for that
which animates it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Matthew Arnold, in "Sweetness and Light," while
discussing the function of that truer culture and "perfection
which consists in becoming something rather
than in having something," remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And this function is particularly important in our
modern world, of which the whole civilization is, to a
much greater degree than the civilization of Greece
and Rome, mechanical and external, and tends constantly
to become more so. But above all in our own
country has culture a weighty part to perform because
here that mechanical character, which civilization
tends to take everywhere, is shown in the most eminent
degree. Indeed, nearly all the characters of
perfection, as culture teaches us to fix them, meet in
this country with some powerful tendency which
thwarts them and sets them at defiance. The idea
of perfection as an inward condition of the mind and
spirit is at variance with the mechanical and material
civilization in esteem with us, and nowhere, as I have
said, so much in esteem as with us."</p>

<p>11. Judged by these higher standards our writers
and literary leaders were not simply Americans. They
were also Europeans. The Puritan brought his religion
with him, the Cavalier acquired his gentlemanly
instincts in the old home, not in the untrodden forests
of the New World. Much of what we call American
is the wine of the Old World poured into the bearskins
and buckskins of the West, with a flavor of the
freedom of our Western wilds. Though born and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
bred on American soil and to the last exemplars of
the American spirit, our literary leaders have derived
their ideas and inspiration from the literature, tradition,
and history of the Old World. It will be no
small part of our purpose, therefore, to open up to
the children of our common schools the best entrance
to the history and literature of Europe. Our own
writers and poets have done this for us in a variety of
instances: Hawthorne's rendering of the Greek myths,
Bryant's translation of the "Iliad" and "Odyssey,"
a good half of Irving's "Sketch-Book," Lowell's
"Vision of Sir Launfal," "Aladdin," and "Prometheus,"
Irving's "Alhambra," Longfellow's "Golden
Legend," "Sandalphon," Taylor's "Boys of Other
Countries." Nearly the whole of our literature, even
when dealing ostensibly with American topics, is suffused
with the spirit and imagery of the Old World
traditions. There is also a large collection of prose
versions of European traditions, which, while not
classic, are still lively renderings of old stories and
well suited to the collateral reading of children. Such
are "Gods and Heroes," "Tales from English History,"
"Tales from Spenser," "Heroes of Asgard,"
"Story of the Iliad and Odyssey."</p>

<p>The transition from our own poets who have
handled European themes to English writers who
have done the same, is easy and natural; Macaulay's
"Lays of Ancient Rome," Scott's "Tales of a Grandfather,"
"The Stories of Waverley," the "Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Carol," Kingsley's "Greek Heroes" and "Water
Babies," Ruskin's "King of the Golden River,"
"Lady of the Lake," "Marmion," "Roger de Coverley
Papers," "Merchant of Venice," "Arabian Nights,"
"Peasant and Prince," Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress,"
"Gulliver's Travels," and others have become
by inheritance and birthright as much a part of the
American child's culture as the more distinctive products
of our own writers. No line can be drawn between
those writings which are American and those
which sprung from the soil of England and Europe.
So intimate and vital is the connection between our
present and our past, between our children and their
cousins across the water.</p>

<p>These American and European literary products lie
side by side in the school course, though the predominating
spirit through the middle and higher grades
up to the eighth should be American. We have
noticed that in the earlier grades most of our classic
reading matter comes from Europe, the nursery
rhymes, the folk-lore, fables, and myths, because
the childhood of our culture periods was in Europe.
But into the fourth grade, and from there on, beginning
with the pioneers on sea and land, our American
history and literature enters as a powerful agent of
culture. It brings us into quick and vital contact, not
simply with the outward facts, but with the inmost
spirit, of our national life and struggle toward development.
This gives the American impulse free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and full expansion, and fortunate are we, beyond
expression, that pure and lofty poets stand at the
threshold to usher the children into this realm,
founded deep in the realism of our past history and
rising grandly into the idealism of our desires and
hopes. As we advance into the sixth, seventh,
and eighth grades the literature of Europe begins
again to increase in quantity and influence, and to
share equally with American authors the attention
of the children.</p>

<p>The Americanism of our poets and prose writers,
as previously shown, has also another side to it, which
is one sign of the breadth and many-sidedness of literature
as a study for the young. North America is
a land rich in variety of natural scenery and resource.
Nature has decked the New World with a lavish hand,
forest and mountain, lake and river, prairie and
desert, the summer land of flowers and the home of
New England winters. The masterpieces of our poets
are full of the scenery, vegetation, sunsets, mountains,
and prairies of the Western empire. The flowers, the
birds, the wild beasts, the pathless forests, the limitless
stretches of plain, have mirrored themselves in
the songs of our poets, and have rendered them
dearer to us because seen and realized in this idealism.
Unconsciously perhaps the feeling of patriotism
is largely based upon this knowledge of the
rich and varied beauty and bounty of our native
land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I love thy rocks and rills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy woods and templed hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart with rapture thrills,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like that above."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As along the shores of our Northern lakes the clear
and quiet waters reflect the green banks, the rolling,
forest-crowned hills, the rocky bluffs, the floating
clouds, and overarching blue, so in the homespun,
classic verse and prose of our own writers are imaged
the myriad charms of our native land. Bryant
especially is the poet of forest and glade, "The Forest
Hymn," "The Death of the Flowers," "The Return
of the Birds," "A Summer Ramble," "The
Fringed Gentian," "The Hunter of the Prairies,"
"The White-footed Deer," "To a Waterfowl,"
"Thanatopsis," and many others. Longfellow's
"Hiawatha," "Evangeline"; Whittier's "Barefoot
Boy," "Songs of Labor," "Among the Hills," and
"Snow-Bound"; Hawthorne's "Tales of the White
Hills"; Holmes's "Spring"; Lowell's "Indian Summer
Reverie," "The Oak," and many more.</p>

<p>The literature selected for these grades has a wide
scope. It is instinct with the best Americanism. It
draws from Europe at every breath, while enjoying
the freedom of the West. Social, political, and home
life and virtue are portrayed in great variety of dress.
Nature also and natural science reveal the myriad
forms of beauty and utility.</p>

<h3>CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING</h3>


<p>1. The Doorway.</p>

<p>There is a strong comfort in the idea that in the
preparation of a masterpiece for a reading class the
teacher may be dealing with a unity of thought in a
variety of relations that makes the study a comprehensive
culture-product both to herself and to the
children. To become a student of "Hiawatha" as a
whole, and in its relations to Indian life and tradition,
early aboriginal history, and Longfellow's connection
with the same, is to throw a deep glance into history
and anthropology, and to recognize literature as the
permanent form of expressing their spirit. There
are a good many side-lights that a teacher needs to
get from history and other literature, and from the
author's life, in order to see a literary masterpiece in
its true setting. It is the part of the poet to make
his work intensely real and ideal, the two elements
that appeal with trenchant force to children. The
teacher needs not only to see the graphic pictures
drawn by the artist, but to gather about these central
points of view other collateral, explanatory facts that
give a deeper setting to the picture. Fortunately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
such study as this is not burdensome. There is a
joyousness and sparkle to it that can relieve many
an hour of tedium. Literature in its best forms is
recreation, and brings an infusion of spiritual energy.
We should not allow ourselves to confuse it with
those more humdrum forms of school employment,
like spelling, figuring, reading in the formal sense,
grammar, writing, etc. Literature is the spiritual
side of school effort, the uplands of thought, where
gushing springs well from the roots and shade of
overarching trees. There is jollity and music, beauty
and grandeur, the freshness of cool breezes and of
mountain scenery, in such profusion as to satisfy the
exuberance of youthful spirit, and to infuse new
energy into old and tired natures. If the teacher
can only get out of the narrow streets of the town
and from between the dead walls of the schoolroom,
up among the meadows and groves and brooks, in
company with Bryant or Longfellow or Whittier, if she
can only take a draught of these spirit-waters before
walking into the schoolroom, her thought and conduct
will be tempered into a fit instrument of culture.</p>

<p>The teacher's preparation is not only in the intellectual
grasp of the thought, but in the sympathy,
feeling, and pleasure germane to a classic. The
&aelig;sthetic and emotional elements, the charm of poetry,
and the sparkle of wit and glint of literary elegance
and aptness are what give relish and delight to true
literary products. Literature appeals to the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
nature and not to the intellect alone. It is not superficial
and formal, but deep and spiritual. The teacher
who reads a classic like "Marmion," thoughtfully
dwelling upon the historic pictures, calling to mind
other of Scott's stories and the earlier struggle between
Scotland and England, is drinking at the fresh
fountains and sources of some of the best parts of
European history. The clear and rock-rimmed lakes
of Scotland, her rugged mountains and ruined castle
walls, are not more delightful to the traveller than the
pictures of life and history that appear in "Tales of
a Grandfather," "Rob Roy," "Marmion," and "Lady
of the Lake." To paint these stirring panoramic
views of Scotch adventure and prowess upon the
imagination of the young is to invigorate their thought
with the real sentiment of patriotism, and with appreciation
for manly struggle, endurance, and spirit.
The vivid insight it gives into feudal society in
church and court and castle, on battle-field and in
dining hall, among the rude peasantry and the unlettered
nobility, is found more lifelike and lasting
than the usual results of historical study.</p>

<p>The moment we take a longer masterpiece and
examine it as a representative piece of human life, or
as a typical portraiture of a historical epoch, it
becomes the converging point for much lively and
suggestive knowledge, deep and strong social interests,
and convincing personification of moral impulses.</p>

<p>The best preparation, therefore, a teacher can make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
for a class is a spiritual and spirited one. At first
the linguistic, formal, verbal mastery of literature, its
critical examination, even its elocution, should remain
in the background both for teacher and children.
Let the direct impress of the thought, motive, and
emotion of the characters be unimpeded; give the
author a chance to speak direct to the hearts of the
children, and the avenue toward the desired results in
formal reading will be left wide open.</p>

<p>We would not deny that a certain labor is required
of the teacher in such preparation. But, in the main,
it is a refreshing kind of labor. If it brings a feeling
of weariness, it is the kind that conduces to
sound and healthy sleep. It invokes a feeling of
inward power and of accumulated rich resource that
helps us to meet with confidence the emergencies
and opportunities of instruction.</p>


<p>2. In the assignment of the lesson the teacher has a
chance to give the children a glimpse of the pleasure
that awaits them, and to catch a little of the enthusiasm
which her own study has awakened. This
should be done briefly and by significant suggestion.
In first introducing a longer work, it will pay to
occupy more than is usual in recitations in opening
up the new subject; if it is historical, in locating the
time, circumstances, and geographical setting. The
chief aim of the assignment should be to awaken
curiosity and interest which may be strong enough to
lead to a full and appreciative study of the lesson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
A second aim of the assignment is to pave the way
to an easier mastery of verbal difficulties that arise,
such as new and difficult words, obscure or involved
passages. The first aim is a substantial and fruitful
one. It approaches the whole reading lesson from
the side of interest and spirit. It seeks to plant
direct incentives and suggestions deep enough in the
mind to start effort. The assignment should take it
for granted that natural interest and absorption in
the thought will lead directly to that kind of vigorous
effort and mastery that will secure natural and expressive
oral reading. Look well to the deeper
springs of thought and action, and the formal reading
will open just the avenue needed to realize good
expression.</p>

<p>Skill, originality, and teaching art are much needed
in the assignment. It is not how much the teacher
says, but the suggestiveness of it, the problems
raised, the questions whose answers lie in the examination
of the lesson. The reference to previous
readings which bear resemblance to this selection;
the inquiry into children's experiences, sets them to
thinking.</p>

<p>Sometimes it pays to spend five or ten minutes in
attacking the difficult words and meanings of the
lesson assigned. Let the class read on and discover
words or phrases that puzzle them. Let difficult
forms be put on the board and syllabicated if necessary.
A brief study of synonymous words and
phrases may be in place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a mistake to decline all helpful and suggestive
study of the next lesson in class, on the ground
that it invalidates the self-activity of children. Self-activity
is, indeed, the chief aim of a good assignment.
It is designed to stimulate the children to
energetic and well-directed effort. Self-activity is
not encouraged by requiring children to struggle
with obstacles they have not the ability to surmount.
Pronouncing new words and searching for dictionary
meanings is often made a mechanical labor which is
irksome and largely fruitless, because the wrong
pronunciations are learned and the definitions do
not fit. Before children are required to use the dictionary
in pronouncing and defining words, they need
careful exercises in how to use and to interpret the
dictionary.</p>

<p>The teacher needs to make a study of the art of
assigning lessons. Clearness and simplicity, so as to
give no ground for misunderstandings, are the result
of thoughtful preparation on the teacher's part.
There is always danger of giving too much or too
little, of carelessness and unsteady requirements,
overburdening the children one day, and even forgetting
the next day to assign a definite task. The
forethought and precision with which a teacher
assigns her lessons is one of the best tests of her
prudence and success in teaching.</p>

<p>It is necessary also to be on one's guard against
hasty assignments. Even when proper care has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
been taken in planning the next lesson, the time
slips by with urgent work, and the signal for dismissal
comes before time has been taken for any
clear assignment.</p>

<p>If the teacher knows just what references will
throw added light upon the lesson, what books and
pages will be directly helpful, if he can appoint different
pupils to look up particular references and
sometimes even go to the library with them and
search for the references, in grades from the fifth
through the eighth, the result may be very helpful.
In the class recitation it is necessary to gather up
the fruits of this reference work with as little waste
of time as possible, recognizing that it is purely
collateral to the main purpose.</p>

<p>Pictures and maps are useful oftentimes as references.
As children advance in the grades, they are
capable of greater independence and judgment in the
use of such materials. General, loose, and indefinite
references are a sign of ignorance, carelessness, and
lack of preparation on the teacher's part. They are
discouraging and unprofitable to children. But we
desire to see children broadening their views, extending
their knowledge of books and of how to use them.
The amount of good literature that can be well
treated and read in the class is small, but much suggestive
outside home and vacation reading may be
encouraged, that will open a still wider and richer
area of personal study.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>3. In spite of all the precautions of the teacher, in
spite of lively interest and intelligent study by the
children, there will be many haltings and blunders,
many inaccuracies in the use of eye and voice.
These faults spring partly from habit and previous
home influences. The worst faults are often those
of which a child is unconscious, so habitual have they
become. If we are to meet these difficulties wisely,
we must start and keep up a strong momentum in
the class. There should be a steady and strong
current of effort in which all share. This depends,
as has been often said, upon the power of the selection
to awaken the thought and feeling of the children.
It depends equally upon the pervasive spirit
and energy of the teacher. If we try to analyze this
complex phenomenon, we may find that, so far as the
children are concerned, two elements are present,
natural and spontaneous absorption in the ideas and
sensibilities awakened by the author, and the bracing
conviction that sustained effort is expected and required
by the teacher. Children, to read well, must
be free; they must feel the force of ideas and of the
emotions and convictions awakened by them. They
must also be conscious of that kind of authority and
control which insists upon serious and sustained
effort. Freedom to exercise their own powers and
obedience to a controlling influence are needful. If
the teacher can secure this right movement and ferment
in a class, she will be able to correct the errors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and change bad habits into the desired form of expression.
The correction of errors, in the main,
should be quiet, incidental, suggestive, not disturbing
the child's thought and effort, not destroying the
momentum of his sentiment and feeling. Let him
move on firmly and vigorously; only direct his movement
here and there, modify his tone by easy suggestions
and pertinent questions, and encourage him as
far as possible in his own effort to appreciate and
express the author's idea.</p>

<p>In reading lessons there are certain purely formal
exercises that are very helpful. The single and concert
pronunciation of difficult or unusual words that
come up in old and new lessons, the vocal exercises
in syllabication and in vowel and consonant drill, are
examples. They should be quick and vigorous, and
preliminary to their application in lessons.</p>


<p>4. The teacher is only a guide and interpreter.
With plenty of reserve power, he should only draw
upon it occasionally. His chief business is not to
show the children how to read by example, nor to be
always explaining and amplifying the thought of the
author. His aim should be to best call the minds of
the children into strong action through the stimulation
of the author's thought, and to go a step farther
and reproduce and mould this thought into oral
expression.</p>

<p>In order to call out the best efforts of children, a
teacher needs to study well the art of questioning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
The range of possibilities in questioning is very
wide. If a rational, sensible question is regarded as
the central or zero point, there are many degrees
below it in the art of questioning and many degrees
above it. Below it is a whole host of half-rational or
useless questions which would better be left unborn:
What does this word mean? Why didn't you study
your lesson? Why weren't you paying attention?
What is the definition of also? How many mistakes
did Mary make?</p>

<p>Much time is sometimes wasted in trying to answer
aimless or trivial questions: Peter, what does
this strange word mean, or how do you pronounce it?
Ethel may try it. Who thinks he can pronounce it
better? Johnny, try it. Perhaps somebody knows
how it ought to be. Sarah, can't you pronounce it?
Finally, after various efforts, the teacher passes on to
something else without even making clear the true
pronunciation or meaning. This is worse than killing
time. It is befuddling the children. A question
should aim clearly at some important idea, and should
bring out a definite result. The children should
have time to think, but not to guess and dawdle, and
then be left groping in the dark.</p>

<p>The chief aim of questions is to arouse vigor and
variety of thought as a means of better appreciation
and expression. Children read poorly because they
do not see the meaning or do not feel the force
of the sentiment. They give wrong emphasis and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
intonation. A good question is like a flash of lightning
which suddenly reveals our standing-ground and
surroundings, and gives the child a chance to strike
out again for himself. His intelligence lights up, he
sees the point, and responds with a significant rendering
of the thought. But the teacher must be a
thinker to ask simple and pertinent questions. He
can't go at it in a loose and lumbering fashion.
Lively and sympathetic and appreciative of the
child's moods and feelings must he be, as well as
clear and definite in his own perception of the
author's meaning.</p>

<p>Questioning for meaning is equivalent to that for
securing expression, and thus two birds are hit with
one stone. A pointed question energizes thought
along a definite line, and leads to a more intense and
vivid perception of the meaning. This is just the
vantage-ground we desire in order to secure good
expression. We wish children not to imitate, but
first to see and feel, and then to express in becoming
wise the thought as they see it and feel it. This
makes reading a genuine performance, not a parrot-like
formalism.</p>


<p>5. Trying to awaken the mental energy and action
of a class as they move on through a masterpiece,
requires constant watchfulness to keep alive their
sense-perceptions and memories, and to touch their
imaginations into constructive effort at every turn in
the road. Through the direct action of the senses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the children have accumulated much variety of sense-materials,
of country and town, of hill, valley, river,
lake, fields, buildings, industries, roads, homes, gardens,
seasons. Out of this vast and varied quarry
they are able to gather materials with which to construct
any landscape or situation you may desire.
Give the children abundance of opportunity to use
these collected riches, and to construct, each in his
own way, the scenes and pictures that the poet's
art so vividly suggests. Many of the questions we
ask of children are designed simply to recall and
reawaken images which lie dormant in their minds,
or, on the other hand, to find out whether they can
combine their old sense-perceptions so skilfully and
vividly as to realize the present situation. Keen and
apt questions will reach down into the depth of a
child's life experiences and bring up concrete images
which the fancy then modifies and adjusts to the
present need. The teacher may often suggest something
in his own observations to kindle like memories
in theirs. Or, if the subject seems unfamiliar, he
may bring on a picture from book or magazine.
Sometimes a sketch or diagram on the board may
give sense-precision and definiteness to the object
discussed, even though it be rudely drawn. This constant
appeal to what is real and tangible and experimental,
not only locates things definitely in time and
space, makes clear and plain what was hazy or meaningless,
awakens interest by connecting the story or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
description with former experiences, but it sets in
action the creative imagination which shapes and
builds up new and pleasing structures, combining old
and new. This kind of mental elaboration, which
reaches back into the senses and forward into the
imagination, is what gives mobility and adjustability to
our mental resources. It is not stiff and rigid and
refractory knowledge that we need. Ideas may
retain their truth and strength, their inward quality,
and still submit to infinite variations and adjustments.
Water is one of the most serviceable of all nature's
compounds, because it has such mobility of form,
such capacity to dissolve and take into solution other
substances, or of being absorbed and even lost sight
of in other bodies. The ideas we have gathered and
stored up from all sources are our building materials;
the imagination is the architect who conceives
the plan and directs the use of different materials
in the growth of the new structures. The teacher's
chief function in reading classes is, on the one
hand, to see that children revive and utilize their
sense-knowledge, and on the other, to wake the
sleeping giant and set him to work to build the
beauteous structures for which the materials have
been prepared. But for this, teachers could be dispensed
with. As Socrates said, they are only
helpers; they stand by, not to perform the work, but
to gently guide, to stimulate, and now and then to
lend a helping hand over a bad place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Explanations, therefore, on the teacher's part,
should be clear and brief, purely tributary to the
main effort. In younger classes, when the children
have, as yet, little ability to use references, the
teacher may add much, especially if it be concrete,
graphic, picturesque, and bearing directly upon the
subject. But as children grow more self-reliant
they can look up facts and references, and bring
more material themselves to the elucidation of the
lesson. But even in adult classes the rich experience
of a trained and wise teacher, whose illustrations are
apt and graphic and criticisms incisive, is an intense
pleasure and stimulus to students.</p>

<p>6. The major part of time and effort in reading
classes should be given to the reading proper, and
not to oral discussions, explanations, and collateral
information and references. It is possible to have
interesting discussions and much use of reference
books, and still make small progress in expressive
reading. The main thing should not be lost sight
of. We should learn to march steadily forward
through lively and energetic thought toward expressive
reading. There is no other right approach to
good reading except through a lively grasp of the
thought, sentiment, and style of the author. But the
side-lights that come from collateral reading and
reference are of great significance. They are something
like the scenery on the stage. They make
the effect more intense and real. They supply a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
background of environment and association which
give the ideas more local significance and a stronger
basis in the whole complex of ideas.</p>

<p>The reading or oral rendering is the final test of
understanding and appreciation of the lesson. The
recitation should focus in this applied art. All
questioning and discussion that do not eventuate in
expressive reading fall short of their proper result.
Reading is a school exercise in which the principles
discussed can be immediately applied, and this is
scarcely true in studies like history, science, and
mathematics. There are many hindrances in the
way of this fruitful result; the teacher is tempted to
talk and explain too much, interesting questions and
controversies spring up, trivial matters receive too
much consideration, much time is spent in the oral
reproduction of the thought; often the time slips by
with a minimum of effective reading.</p>

<p>The questions, discussions, collateral references,
and explanations should be brought into immediate
connection with the children's reading, so that the
special thought may produce its effect upon expression.
This test of effectiveness is a good one to
apply to explanations, definitions, and questions.
Unless they produce a pronounced effect upon the
reading, they are largely superfluous. In view of
this the teacher will learn to be sparing of words,
laconic and definite in statement, pointed and clear
in questioning, and energetic in pushing forward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
While interest in the thought-content is the impelling
motive in good reading exercises, lively and
natural expression is likewise the proper fruit and
outcome of such a motive carried to its proper end.</p>

<p>7. In order to keep up the right interest and
movement, it is necessary to give considerable variety
to the work. A teacher's good sense and tact
should be like a thermometer which registers the
mental temperature of the class. If kept too long at
a single line of effort, its monotony induces carelessness
and inattention; while a total change to some
other order of exercise would awake their interest
and zeal. Variety is needed also within the compass
of a single recitation, because there are several preliminaries
and varieties of preparatory drill which
conduce to good rendering of any selection. Such
are vocal exercises in consonants and vowels; pronunciation
and syllabication of new or difficult
words; physical exercises to put the body and nervous
system into proper tone; the assignment of the
next lesson, requiring a peculiar effort and manner
of treatment; the report and discussion of references;
concert drills; the study of meanings&mdash;synonyms
and derivations; illustrations and information
by the teacher; introduction of other illustrative matter,
as pictures, drawings, maps, and diagrams.
Variety can be given to each lesson in many ways
according to the ingenuity of the teacher. If we are
reading a number of short selections, they themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
furnish different varieties and types of prose and
verse. The dramatist or novelist provides for such
variety by introducing a series of diverse scenes, all
leading forward to a common end.</p>

<p>8. Parallel to the requirement of variety is the
equally important demand that children should learn
to do one thing at a time and learn to do it well.
This may appear contradictory to the former requirement,
but the skill and tact of the teacher is what
should solve this seeming contradiction. It is a fact
that we try to do too many things in each reading
lesson. We fail to pound on one nail long enough
to drive it in. Reading lessons often resemble a
child pounding nails into a board. He strikes one
nail a blow or two, then another, and so on until a
dozen or more are in all stages of incompleteness.
We too often allow the recitation hour to end with a
number of such incomplete efforts. Good reading is
not like moving a house, when it is all carried along
in one piece. We reach better results if we concentrate
attention and effort during a recitation along
the line of a narrow aim. At least this seems true
of the more formal, mechanical side of reading. It
is better to try to break up bad habits, one at a time,
rather than to make a general, indefinite onslaught
upon all together. Suppose, for example, that the
teacher suggests as an aim of the lesson conversational
reading, or that which sounds like pupils talking
to each other. Many dialogue selections admit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of such an aim as this. If this aim is set up at the
beginning of the lesson, the children's minds will be
rendered acute in this direction; they will be on the
alert for this kind of game. Each child who reads
is scrutinized by teacher and pupils to see how near
he comes to the ideal. A conscious effort begins to
dominate the class to reach this specific goal. Children
may close their eyes and listen to see if the
reading has the right sound. A girl or boy goes
into an adjoining entry or dressing room and listens
to see if those in the class are reading or talking.
The enthusiasm and class spirit awakened are very
helpful. Not that a whole recitation should be given
up to that sort of thing, but it is the characteristic
effort of the lesson. When the children practise the
next lesson at home they will have this point in
mind.</p>

<p>For several days this sort of specific, definite aim
at a narrow result may be followed up in the class
till the children begin to acquire power in this direction.
What was, at first, painfully conscious effort
begins to assume the form of habit, and when this
result is achieved, we may drop this aim as a leading
one in the recitation, and turn our attention to some
different line of effort. Distinct pronunciation of
sounds is one of the things that we are always aiming
at, in a general way, and never getting. Why
not set this up in a series of recitations as a definite
aim, and resort to a series of devices to lay bare the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
kind of faults the children are habitually guilty of?
Give them a chance to correct these faults, and awake
the class spirit in this direction. It will not be difficult
to convince them that they are not pronouncing
their final consonants, like <i>d</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>k</i>. Keep
the attention for a lesson to this kind of error till
there is recognizable improvement. Then notice
the short vowel sounds in the unaccented syllables,
and give them search-light attention. Notice later
the syllables that children commonly slur over.
Mark these fugitives, and see if they continue so
invisible and inaudible. They are like Jack the
Giant Killer, when he put on his cloak of invisibility,
or like Perseus under similar circumstances.
See if we can find these fellows who seem to masquerade
and dodge about behind their companions.
Then some of the long vowels and diphthongs will
require investigation. They are not all so open-faced
and above board as they might be. When
children have such a simple and distinct aim in
view, they are ready to work with a vim and to
exert themselves in a conscious effort at improvement.
Keep this aim foremost in the recitation,
although other requirements of good reading are
not wholly neglected.</p>

<p>After a definite line of effort has been strongly
developed as one of the above described, it is possible
thereafter to keep it in mind with slight attention.
But if no special drill has ever been devoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to it for a given length of time, it has not been
brought so distinctly to mind as to produce a lasting
impression and to lay the basis for habit. Besides
the two aims, clear articulation and conversational
tones, there are others that may be labored at similarly.
Appreciation of the thought as expressed by
the reading is a rich field for critical study of a piece,
and as a basis for observing and judging the children's
reading. This idea is well implied by such
questions as follow: Is that what the passage
means? Have you given expression to the author's
meaning by emphasis on this word? Does your
rendering of this passage make good sense? Compare
it with what precedes. How did the man feel
when he said this? What do we know of his character
that would lead us to expect such words from
him? This line of questions has a wide and varied
range. The chief thing is to scrutinize the thought
in all the light attainable, and appeal to the child's
own judgment as to the suitableness of the tone and
emphasis to the thought. Does it sound right? Is
that what the passage means?</p>

<p>Each characteristic form of prose or verse has a
peculiar style and force of expression that calls for a
corresponding oral rendering. There is the serious
and massive, though simple, diction of Webster's
speeches, with its smooth and rounded periods, calling
for slow and steady and energetic reading. We
should notice this characteristic of an author, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
grow into sympathy with his feeling, language, and
mental movement. In Macaulay's "Lays of Ancient
Rome," the ring of martial music is in the words, and
it swells out into rapid and rousing speech which
should correspond to the thought. In "Evangeline"
the flow of language is placid and gentle and rhythmical,
and in consonance with the gentle faith and
hope of Evangeline. Every true literary product
has its own character, which the genius of the author
has impressed upon its language and moulded into
its structure, and which calls for a rendering fit and
appropriate. Before completing a selection, we
should detect this essence and quality and bring our
reading to reveal it. The places should be pointed
out where it comes into prominence.</p>

<p>When completing such a work of art there should
be given opportunity to bring all the varied elements
and special aims discovered and worked out during
its reading to a focus.</p>

<p>In the final review and rereading of a complete
poem or prose selection the points of excellence in
reading which have been the special aims of effort
in the studies of the piece should be kept sharply in
mind and pushed to a full expression. The realization
of these various aims may be set before the
class as the distinct object of their closing work on a
masterpiece. The failure to hold vigorously to this
final achievement is a clear sign of intellectual and
moral lassitude. Reading, as noticed before, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
one of the few studies in which the final application
of theory to practice can be effected, and children
may realize that things are learned for the sake of
using them, and not simply against some future contingency.
This implies, however, much resource
and skill on the teacher's part in awakening the children.
The impulses and aims which arouse the
children to strenuous effort should spring from
within, and should be expressions of their own self-activity
and volition. There is much need of the
enthusiasm and will-energy that overcome drudgery.
Children should be taught to be dissatisfied with anything
less than real accomplishment.</p>

<p>The children will naturally memorize certain passages
which strike their fancy. Other passages
have been suggested by the teacher for different
pupils to memorize. In one of the closing lessons
let the children recite these parts before the class.
If the teacher has succeeded in calling out the live
interest of the class during the previous study, such
a lesson will be a joy to both pupils and teacher.
One or two of the children may also volunteer or be
appointed to make an oral statement of the argument,
which will give freedom to natural and effective
speech. Such a round-up of the reading lessons
at the end of a series of interesting studies is a
rich experience to the whole class.</p>

<p>Besides the important special aims thus far suggested,
which should each stand out clear for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
series of lessons until its value is realized and worked
over into habit, there are other subordinate aims that
deserve particular and individual consideration, and
may now and then become the dominant purpose of
a lesson. Such are the correction of singsong reading,
the use of the dictionary, the study of synonyms
and antitheses, the comparisons and figures of speech,
exercises in sight reading of unfamiliar selections,
quotations from selections and masterpieces already
read, study of the lives and works of authors.</p>

<p>Reading is a many-sided study, and to approach
its difficulties with success we must take them up one
at a time, conquering them in detail. Good housekeepers
and cooks are accustomed to lay out a series
of dinners in which the chief article of diet is varied
from day to day as follows: chicken pie with oysters,
veal potpie, stewed fish, broiled beefsteak, venison
roast, bean soup with ham, roast mutton, baked fish,
broiled quail, roast beef, baked chicken with parsnips,
etc. Such a series of dinners gives a healthy variety
and relish. It is better for most people than the bill
of fare at a large hotel, where there is so much
variety and sameness each day. When we try each
day to do everything in a reading lesson, we grasp
more than our hands can hold, and most of it falls to
the ground. Children are pleased and encouraged
by actual progress in surmounting difficulties when
they are presented one at a time, and opportunity is
given for complete mastery. The children should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
labor consciously and vigorously at one line of effort,
be it distinctness or rhythm or emphasis or conversational
tone, till decided improvement and progress are
attained, and the ease of right habit begins to show
itself. Then we can turn to some new field, securing
and holding the vantage-ground of our foregoing
effort by occasional reminders.</p>

<p>9. One of the best tests applied to a reading class
is their degree of class attention. The steadiness
and responsiveness with which the whole class follow
the work is a fair measure of successful teaching.
To have but one child read at a time while the
others wait their turn or scatter their thoughts, is
very bad. It is a good sign of a teacher's skill and
efficiency to see every child in energetic pursuit of
the reading. It conduces to the best progress in
that study and is the genesis of right mental habit.</p>

<p>Attention is a <i>sine qua non</i> to good teaching, and
yet it is a result rather than a cause. It is a ripe
fruit rather than the spring promise of it. The provisions
which lead up to steady attention are deserving
of a teacher's study and patient scrutiny. She
may command attention for a moment by sheer force
of will and personality, but it must have something
to feed upon the next moment and the next, or it will
be wandering in distant fields. So great and indispensable
is the value of attention, that some teachers
try to secure it at too heavy a cost. They command,
threaten, punish. They resort to severity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
cruelty. But the more formidable the teacher becomes,
the more difficult for a child to do his duty.
Here, again, we can best afford to go back to the
sources from which attention naturally springs,
interesting subject of thought, vivid and concrete
perceptions, lively and suggestive appeal to the imagination,
the sphere of noble thought and emotion,
variety and movement in mental effort, a mutual
sympathy and harmony between teacher and pupil.</p>

<p>It is indeed well for the teacher to gauge his work
by the kind and intensity of attention he can secure.
If the class has dropped into slothful and habitual
carelessness and inattention, he will have to give them
a few severe jolts; he must drop questions where
they are least expected. He must be very alert to
detect a listless child and wake him into action. The
vigor, personal will, and keen watchfulness of the
teacher must be a constant resource. On the other
hand, let him look well to the thought, the feeling,
and capacity of the children, and give them matter
which is equal to their merits.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to find the teacher's eye following
the text closely instead of watching the class. But
the teacher's eye should be moving alertly among the
children. In case he has studied the lesson carefully,
the teacher can detect almost every mistake without
the book. In fact, even if one has not recently read
a selection, he can usually detect a verbal error by
the break or incoherency of the thought. Moreover,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the teacher can better judge the expressiveness of the
reading by listening to it than by following the text
with his eye. Depending wholly upon the ear, any
defect of utterance or ineptness of expression is
quickly detected. Even the children at times should
be asked to close their books and to listen closely to
the reading. This emphasizes the notion that good
reading is the oral expression of thought, so that
those who listen can understand and enjoy it.</p>

<p>The treadmill style of reading, which repeats and
repeats, doing the same things day by day, going
through the like round of mechanical motions, should
give way to a rational, spirited, variegated method
which arouses interest and variety of thought, and
moves ever toward a conscious goal.</p>

<p>10. In studying the masterpieces of great writers,
a question arises how to treat the moral situations involved
in the stories. In their revolt against excessive
moralizing with children, some critics object to
any direct teaching of moral ideas in connection with
literature, being opposed to explicit discussions of
moral notions.</p>

<p>All will admit that literature, dealing as it does
with human life, is surcharged with practical morality,
with social conduct. It is also the motive of great
writers, while dealing honestly with human nature, to
idealize and beautify their representations of men.
Nor is it their purpose to make unworthy characters
pleasing and attractive models.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>It is expected, of course, that children will get
clear notions and opinions of such persons as Miles
Standish and John Alden, of Whittier's father and
mother and others in the fireside circle of "Snow-Bound,"
of Antonio and Shylock in the "Merchant of
Venice," of Cinderella and her sisters in the story, of
Wallace and Bruce in Scott's "Tales," of Gluck and
his brothers in Ruskin's story, of Scrooge in the
"Christmas Carol," of Evangeline, Enoch Arden, etc.</p>

<p>But boys and girls are not infallible judges of
character. They are apt to form erroneous or one-sided
judgments from lack of insight into the author's
meaning, or from carelessness. There is the same
possibility of error in forming moral judgments as
in forming judgments in other phases of an author's
thought.</p>

<p>It is the province of the teacher to stimulate the
children to think, and, by his superior experience and
judgment, to guide them into correct thinking. It
is not the function of the teacher to impose his ready-made
judgments upon children, either in morals or
in anything else. But it is his concern, by questions,
suggestions, and criticisms, to aid in clarifying the
thought, to put the children upon the right track.
There is no reason why a teacher should abdicate his
place of instructor because he chances to come before
moral problems. Literature is full of moral
situations, moral problems, and moral evolutions in
character, and even of moral ideals. Is the teacher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to stand dumb before these things as if he had lost
his wits? Or is he to consider it the greatest opportunity
of his life to prudently guide young people
to the correct perception of what is beautiful and
true in human life? Why, indeed, should he suppress
his own enthusiasm for these ideals? Why
should not his personality be free to express itself
in matters of moral concern, as well as in intellectual
and &aelig;sthetic judgments? So long as the teacher
throws the pupils back upon their own self-activity
and thinking power, there need be no danger of
moral pedantry or of moral dyspepsia.</p>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that the teacher should
use freedom and boldness in discussing with the
children candidly and thoughtfully the characters
presented in good literature. Let the situations be
made clear so that correct judgments of single acts
can be formed. Let the weaknesses and virtues of
the persons be noted. Let motives be studied and
characteristic tendencies traced out. In this way
children may gradually increase their insight and
enlarge the range of their knowledge of social life.
If these things are not legitimate, why should such
materials be presented to children at all? We need
not make premature moralists of children, or teach
them to pass easy or flippant moral judgments upon
others. But we wish their interest in these characters
to be deep and genuine, their eyes wide open
to the truths of life, and their intuitive moral judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ments
to ripen in a healthy and hearty social environment.
To this end the teacher will need to use all
his skill in questioning, in suggestion, in frank and
candid discussion. In short, he needs just those
qualities which a first-class teacher needs in any
field of study.</p>

<p>We have gotten out of the mode of tacking a
moral to a story. Ostensibly moral stories, overweighted
with a moral purpose, do not please us.
We wish novelists and dramatists to give us the
truth of life, and leave us to pass judgment upon
the characters. Our best literature presents great
variety of scenes and characterizations in their
natural setting in life. They specially cultivate
moral judgment and insight. One of the ultimate
standards which we apply to all novels and dramas
is that of their fundamental moral truth. Schlegel,
in his "Dramatic Art and Literature," in his criticisms
of great writers, discusses again and again
the moral import of the characters, and even the
moral purpose of Shakespeare and the dramatists.
In fact, these moral considerations lie deep and fundamental
in judging the great works of literary art.
The masterpieces we use in the schools bear the
same relation to the children that the more difficult
works bear to adults.</p>

<p>The clear discussion of the moral element in literature
seems, therefore, natural and legitimate, while
its neglect and obscuration would be a fatal defect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>11. There are two kinds of reading which should
be cultivated in reading lessons, although they seem
to fall a little apart from the main highway of effort.
They are, first, sight reading of supplementary matter
for the purpose of cultivating a quick and accurate
grasp of new thought and forms. When we leave
school, one of the values of reading will be the power
it gives to interpret quickly and grasp firmly the
ideas as they present themselves in the magazines,
papers, and books we read. Good efforts in school
reading will lead forward gradually to that readiness
of thought and fluency of perception which will give
freedom and mastery of new reading matter. To
develop this ability and to regulate it into habit, we
must give children a chance to read quite a little
at sight. We need supplementary readers in sets
which can be put into the hands of children for this
purpose. The same books will answer for several
classes, and may be passed from room to room of
similar grade.</p>

<p>The reading matter we select for this purpose
may be classic, and of the best quality, just as well
as to be limited to information and geographical
readers which are much inferior. There are first-class
books of literary merit, which are entirely serviceable
for this purpose and much richer in culture.
They continue the line of study in classic literature,
and give ground for suggestive comparisons and
reviews which should not be neglected. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
a strong tendency in our time to put inferior reading
matter, in the form of information readers, science
primers, short history stories, geographical readers,
newspapers, and specially prepared topics on current
events, into reading classes. These things may do
well enough in their proper place in geography, history,
natural science, or general lessons, but they
should appear scarcely at all in reading lessons.
Preserve the reading hour for that which is choicest
in our prose and verse, mainly in the form of shorter
or longer masterpieces of literature.</p>

<p>Secondly, many books should be brought to the
attention of the children which they may read outside
of school. The regular reading exercises should give
the children a lively and attractive introduction to some
of the best authors, and a taste for the strength and
beauty of their productions. But the field of literature
is so wide and varied that many things can only
be suggested, which will remain for the future leisure
and choice of readers. Children might, however,
be made acquainted with some of the best books
suited to their age for which there is not school time.
Many of the best books, like "Ivanhoe," "Quentin
Durward," "Captains Courageous," "Swiss Family
Robinson," and "Nicholas Nickleby," cannot be read
in school. They should be in the school library, and
the teacher should often refer to them and to others
suggested by the regular reading, which give deeper
and wider views into life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>12. In the use of the symbols and language forms
of reading, the children should be led on to freedom
and self-activity. How to get the mastery of
these forms in the early reading work is discussed
in the "Special Method in Primary Reading and
Story."</p>

<p>In the fourth and fifth years of school, children
should learn to use the dictionary. It is a great
means of self-help when they have learned to interpret
the dictionary easily. But special lessons are
necessary to teach children: first, how to find words
in the dictionary; second, how to interpret the
diacritical markings so as to get a correct pronunciation;
and third, how to discriminate among definitions.
Adults and even teachers are often deficient in these
particulars, and children will not form habits of using
the dictionary with quick and easy confidence without
continuous, attentive care on the teacher's part.
The best outcome of such training is the conscious
power of the child to help himself, and there is
nothing in school work more deserving of encouragement.</p>

<p>The system of diacritical markings used in the
dictionary should be put on the blackboard, varied
illustrations of the markings given, and the application
of these markings to new words in the dictionary
discovered. Lack of success in this work is chiefly
due to a failure to pursue this plan steadily till ease
and mastery are gained and habits formed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>In the later grades these habits of self-help should
be kept up and extended further to the study of
synonyms, root words and their kindred, homonyms,
prefixes and suffixes, and the derived meanings of
words.</p>

<h3>METHOD FURTHER DISCUSSED AND ILLUSTRATED.<br />
SUMMARY</h3>


<p>In the following chapter some phases of method
not fully treated before will be discussed and illustrated.</p>

<p>1. The proposal to treat literary masterpieces as
units of thought implies a searching study and sifting
out of the essential idea in each poem or selection.
In some, both of the longer and shorter pieces, it is
not difficult to detect the motive. In Bryant's "Ode
to a Waterfowl," it is even suggested as a sort of
moral at the close. Likewise in the "Pied Piper of
Hamelin," and in Burns's "Tam O'Shanter." In
"Glaucis and Philemon," as well as in "The Golden
Touch," even a child can quickly discern the controlling
idea of the myth. But in many of our
choicest literary products it requires deliberate
thought to discover the poet's deeper meaning,
especially that idea which binds all the parts together
and gives unity to the whole. In Lowell's address
"To the Dandelion," we may find in each stanza the
gleam of the golden thread which unifies the whole.
The first lines suggest it:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dear common flower, that grow'st beside the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again in the second stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis the Spring's largess which she scatters now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rich and poor alike, with lavish hand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the succeeding stanzas he calls to mind how the
dandelion suggests the riches of the tropics, the full
promise of summer, the pure joys of childhood, the
common loving courtesies of life, the rich love and
prodigality of nature, and the divinity in every human
heart.</p>

<p>When by reflection we bind all these thoughts
together, and find that they focus in the idea that
the best riches abound and even burst forth out of
common things and from the hearts of common men
and women, we realize that the poet has brought
us to the point of discovering a deep and practical
truth, which, put to work in the world, would bring
rhythm and harmony into human life.</p>

<p>But such a deep impression is not made by a
superficial or fragmental study of the poem.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar result may be wrought out
by the study of Lowell's poem, "An Incident in a
Railroad Car," and the idea is well expressed in the
verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Never did poesy appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So full of heaven to me as when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw how it would pierce through pride and fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lives of coarsest men."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>The study of a poem or other masterpiece in this
way, to get at its inner life and continuity, reveals to
us an interesting process of mental elaboration and
comparative thought. Such self-active reflection is
the subsoiling of the mind.</p>

<p>To set children to work upon problems of this
sort, to put them in the way of thinking and feeling
for themselves, and that too even in the longer classics
like "Evangeline," "Enoch Arden," "Silas
Marner," etc., is to bring such studies into the
realm of great culture-producing agencies.</p>

<p>Many minor questions of method will be solved by
having these centres of thought, these problems for
thinkers. Teachers are bothered to know what sort
of questions to ask. It would be safe to say, those
questions which move in the direction of the main
truth, toward the solution of the chief problem.
But let the questions be shrewd, not revealing too
much, stimulating to thoughtfulness and heading
off errors. To what extent shall geographical,
historical, or biographical facts be gathered for the
enrichment and clarifying of the poem? Those
materials which throw necessary light on the essential
ideas, omitting what is irrelevant and secondary.</p>

<p>A careful study of the life of Alexander, by
Plutarch, will bring to light, more than anything
else, his magnanimity. The thing that so much
distinguished him from other men was his large,
liberal temper, displayed on many various occasions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>It reminds the mature student of that remarkable
utterance of Burke, "Great affairs and little minds
go ill together." The large-minded statesmanship
with which Burke discusses conciliation with the
colonies is of like quality with this magnanimous
spirit of Alexander.</p>

<p>One who reads receptively Emerson's "The Fortune
of the Republic" will open his eyes on two
opposite but closely related ideas, the serious faults,&mdash;the
low political tone, the materialism, the spread-eagle
strut and slovenly mediocrity of much in American
life,&mdash;and over against this the splendid promise,
manliness, and intense idealism of our national life.
To work out this conception in the brains of young
people and let it kindle their hearts with some true
glow of patriotism, is the highest form of teaching.
Such instruction would convert every schoolhouse
into a true temple of freedom and patriotism.</p>

<p>But in order to reach these results both teachers
and pupils must put their minds to the stretch of
earnest work. In the introduction to the above-named
essay of Emerson, in the "Riverside Literature
Series," occurs the following interesting and
suggestive passage: "Yet many of his most notable
addresses were given before audiences of young men
and women, and out of the great body of his writings
it is not difficult to find many passages which go
straight to the intelligence of boys and girls in
school. The plan of this series forbids the use of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
extracts, or many numbers might be filled with striking
and appropriate passages from Emerson's writings;
but there are certain essays and addresses
which, though they may contain some knotty sentences,
are in the main so interesting to boys and
girls who have begun to think, they are so inspiring
and yield so much to any one who will take a little
trouble to use his mind, that it is obviously desirable
to bring them in convenient form to the attention
of schools. Some of the best things in literature we
can get only by digging for them; and there is great
satisfaction in reading again and again masterpieces
like the essays in this collection, with a fresh
pleasure in each reading as new ideas spring up in
the mind of the attentive reader."</p>

<p>It will be a day rich in promise and fruitful of
great things when the general body of our teachers
take hold of our great American classics in this
determined spirit, treating them as wholes and grasping
firmly the essential fundamental ideas.</p>

<p>2. It is in the thought-analysis of a reading lesson
that a teacher's wit and wisdom are brought to the
severest test. The words of Shakespeare may be
applied to the teacher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A prince most prudent, of an excellent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unmatched wit and judgment."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is much danger of wasting time in formal
questions, questions striking no spark of interest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
questions on familiar words that really need no
elucidation, vague and unpremeditated questions that
make no forward step. Simple, far-reaching questions,
which touch the pupils' deeper thoughtfulness
in preparing the lesson and stimulate his self-active
effort, are needed. If the teacher has become keenly
interested, he will ask more telling questions. If he
has probed into the author's secret,&mdash;the thing which
he has been hinting at and only gives occasional
glimpses of to whet your curiosity,&mdash;he will discover
that thought-getting is almost a tantalizing
process with great writers. The teacher must spur
and almost tantalize the children with a similar
shrewdness of question.</p>

<p>Problem-raising questions, involving thoughtful
retrospect and shrewd anticipation, questions which
cannot be answered offhand but lead on to a deeper
study, are at a premium. Ruskin says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And, therefore, first of all, I tell you earnestly
and authoritatively (I know I am right in this), you
must get into the habit of looking intensely at
words and assuring yourself of their meaning, syllable
by syllable,&mdash;nay, letter by letter." Again
he says, of a well-educated gentleman, that "above
all he is learned in the peerage of words; knows
the words of true descent and ancient blood at a
glance from words of modern canaille."</p>

<p>In order to make his thought unmistakable, I
quote at length a passage from Ruskin's "Sesame
and Lilies":<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, merely for example's sake, I will, with
your permission, read a few lines of a true book with
you, carefully; and see what will come out of them.
I will take a book perfectly known to you all; no
English words are more familiar to us, yet nothing
perhaps has been less read with sincerity. I will
take these few following lines of 'Lycidas':&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Last came, and last did go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pilot of the Galilean lake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two massy keys he bore of metals twain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"Let us think over this passage, and examine its
words.</p>

<p>"First, is it not singular to find Milton assigning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to St. Peter, not only his full episcopal function,
but the very types of it which Protestants usually
refuse most passionately? His 'mitred' locks! Milton
was no Bishop-lover; how comes St. Peter to be
'mitred'? 'Two massy keys he bore.' Is this,
then, the power of the keys claimed by the Bishops
of Rome, and is it acknowledged here by Milton
only in a poetical license, for the sake of its picturesqueness;
that he may get the gleam of the golden
keys to help his effect? Do not think it. Great
men do not play stage tricks with doctrines of
life and death: only little men do that. Milton
means what he says; and means it with his might,
too,&mdash;is going to put the whole strength of his
spirit presently into the saying of it. For though
not a lover of false bishops, he was a lover of true
ones; and the lake-pilot is here, in his thoughts,
the type and head of true episcopal power. For
Milton reads that text, 'I will give unto thee the
keys of the kingdom of Heaven,' quite honestly.
Puritan though he be, he would not blot it out of
the book because there have been bad bishops;
nay, in order to understand him, we must understand
that verse first; it will not do to eye it askance,
or whisper it under our breath, as if it were a
weapon of an adverse sect. It is a solemn, universal
assertion, deeply to be kept in mind by all
sects. But perhaps we shall be better able to reason
on it if we go on a little farther, and come back to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
For clearly, this marked insistence on the power of
the true episcopate is to make us feel more weightily
what is to be charged against the false claimants
of episcopate; or generally, against false claimants
of power and rank in the body of the clergy; they
who, 'for their bellies' sake, creep, and intrude, and
climb into the fold.'</p>

<p>"Do not think Milton uses those three words
to fill up his verse, as a loose writer would. He
needs all the three; specially those three, and no
more than those&mdash;'creep,' and 'intrude,' and
'climb'; no other words would or could serve the
turn, and no more could be added. For they
exhaustively comprehend the three classes, correspondent
to the three characters, of men who dishonestly
seek ecclesiastical power. First, those
who 'creep' into the fold; who do not care for
office, nor name, but for secret influence, and do
all things occultly and cunningly, consenting to
any servility of office or conduct, so only that
they may intimately discern, and unawares direct
the minds of men. Then those who 'intrude'
(thrust, that is) themselves into the fold, who by
natural insolence of heart, and stout eloquence of
tongue, and fearlessly perseverant self-assertion,
obtain hearing and authority with the common
crowd. Lastly, those who 'climb,' who by labor
and learning, both stout and sound, but selfishly
exerted in the cause of their own ambition, gain high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
dignities and authorities, and become 'lords over
the heritage,' though not 'ensamples to the flock.'</p>

<p>"Now go on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Of other care they little reckoning make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind mouths&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I pause again, for this is a strange expression;
a broken metaphor, one might think, careless and
unscholarly.</p>

<p>"Not so: its very audacity and pithiness are intended
to make us look close at the phrase and
remember it. Those two monosyllables express
the precisely accurate contraries of right character,
in the two great offices of the Church&mdash;those of
bishop and pastor.</p>

<p>"A Bishop means a person who sees.</p>

<p>"A Pastor means one who feeds.</p>

<p>"The most unbishoply character a man can have
is therefore to be Blind.</p>

<p>"The most unpastoral is, instead of feeding, to
want to be fed,&mdash;to be a Mouth.</p>

<p>"Take the two reverses together, and you have
'blind mouths.'  We may advisably follow out this
idea a little. Nearly all the evils in the Church
have arisen from bishops desiring power more than
light. They want authority, not outlook. Whereas
their real office is not to rule; though it may be
vigorously to exhort and rebuke; it is the king's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
office to rule; the bishop's office is to oversee the
flock; to number it, sheep by sheep; to be ready
always to give full account of it. Now it is clear
he cannot give account of the souls, if he has not
so much as numbered the bodies of his flock. The
first thing, therefore, that a bishop has to do is at
least to put himself in a position in which, at any
moment, he can obtain the history from childhood
of every living soul in his diocese, and of its present
state. Down in that back street, Bill, and
Nancy, knocking each other's teeth out!&mdash;Does the
bishop know all about it? Has he his eye upon
them? Has he had his eye upon them? Can
he circumstantially explain to us how Bill got
into the habit of beating Nancy about the head?
If he cannot, he is no bishop, though he had a
mitre as high as Salisbury steeple; he is no bishop,&mdash;he
has sought to be at the helm instead of
the masthead; he has no sight of things. 'Nay,'
you say, it is not his duty to look after Bill in the
back street. What! the fat sheep that have full
fleeces&mdash;you think it is only those he should look
after, while (go back to your Milton) 'the hungry
sheep look up, and are not fed, besides what the
grim wolf with privy paw' (bishops knowing nothing
about it) 'daily devours apace, and nothing said'?</p>

<p>"'But that's not our idea of a bishop.' Perhaps
not; but it was St. Paul's; and it was Milton's.
They may be right, or we may be; but we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
not think we are reading either one or the other by
putting our meaning into their words.</p>

<p>"I go on.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'But, swolln with wind, and the rank mist they draw.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This is to meet the vulgar answer that 'if the
poor are not looked after in their bodies, they are in
their souls; they have spiritual food.'</p>

<p>"And Milton says, 'They have no such thing as
spiritual food; they are only swolln with wind.'
At first you may think that is a coarse type, and
an obscure one. But, again, it is a quite literally
accurate one. Take up your Latin and Greek dictionaries,
and find out the meaning of 'Spirit.' It
is only a contraction of the Latin word 'breath,'
and an indistinct translation of the Greek word for
'wind.' The same word is used in writing. 'The
wind bloweth where it listeth;' and 'So is every
one that is born of the Spirit,' born of the breath,
that is, for it means the breath of God, in soul
and body. We have the true sense of it in our
words 'inspiration' and 'expire.' Now, there are
two kinds of breath with which the flock may be
filled; God's breath and man's. The breath of God
is health and life and peace to them, as the air
of heaven is to the flocks on the hills; but man's
breath&mdash;the word he calls spiritual&mdash;is disease and
contagion to them, as the fog of the fen. They rot
inwardly with it; they are puffed up by it, as a body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
by the vapors of its own decomposition. This is
literally true of all false religious teaching; the first
and last and fatalest sign of it is that 'puffing up.'</p>

<p>"Lastly, let us return to the lines respecting the
power of the keys, for now we can understand them.
Note the difference between Milton and Dante in
their interpretation of this power; for once the latter
is weaker in thought; he supposes both the keys to
be of the gate of heaven; one is of gold, the other of
silver; they are given by St. Peter to the sentinel angel,
and it is not easy to determine the meaning either of
the substances of the three steps of the gate or of
the two keys. But Milton makes one, of gold, the key
of heaven; the other, of iron, the key of the prison,
in which the wicked teachers are to be bound who
'have taken away the key of knowledge, yet entered
not in themselves.'</p>

<p>"We have seen that the duties of bishop and
pastor are to see and feed, and, of all who do so,
it is said, 'He that watereth, shall be watered also
himself.' But the reverse is truth also. He that
watereth not, shall be withered himself, and he that
seeth not, shall himself be shut out of sight,&mdash;shut
into the perpetual prison house. And that prison
opens here as well as hereafter; he who is to be
bound in heaven must first be bound on earth. That
command to the strong angels, of which the rock-apostle
is the image, 'Take him, and bind him hand
and foot, and cast him out,' issues, in its measure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
against the teacher for every help withheld, and for
every truth refused, and for every falsehood enforced;
so that he is more strictly fettered the more he fetters,
and further outcast as he more and more misleads,
till at last the bars of the iron cage close upon him,
and as 'the golden opes, the iron shuts amain.'</p>

<p>"We have got something out of the lines, I think,
and much more is yet to be found in them; but we
have done enough by way of example of the kind of
word-by-word examination of your author which is
rightly called 'reading,' watching every accent and
expression, and putting ourselves always in the author's
place, annihilating our own personality, and seeking
to enter into his, so as to be able assuredly to say,
'Thus Milton thought,' not 'Thus I thought, in misreading
Milton.'"</p>

<p>3. In reading successive poems and prose selections
from different authors, strong resemblances in thought
or language are frequently detected. It is a thought-provoking
process to bring such similar passages to
a definite comparison. Even where the same topic
is treated differently by two authors, the different
or contrasted points of view are suggestive. Calling
such familiar passages to mind is in itself a good
practice, and it is well to cultivate this mode of
turning previous knowledge into use.</p>

<p>To illustrate this point, let us call to mind some
familiar passages, touching the winter snow-storm
and the fireside comforts, from Whittier, Emerson,
and Lowell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Whittier's description of a snow-storm in "Snow-Bound"
is well known:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And whirl-dance of the blinding storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As zigzag wavering to and fro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crossed and recrossed the winged snow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the early bedtime came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white drift piled the window-frame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Come see the north wind's masonry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of an unseen quarry evermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curves his white bastions with projected roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For number or proportion. Mockingly,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The architecture of the snow can be compared
point by point in both authors, in the objects about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the farmhouse, while the picture of the snug comforts
of the fireplace is in both.</p>

<p>Of a somewhat different, yet closely related, character
is the description in the Prelude to Part Second,
in the "Vision of Sir Launfal":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the snow five thousand summers old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On open wold and hill-top bleak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It had gathered all the cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer's cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It carried a shiver everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the unleafed boughs and pastures bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little brook heard it and built a roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath which he could house him, winter-proof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night by the white stars' frosty gleams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He groined his arches and matched his beams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slender and clear were his crystal spars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the lashes of light that trim the stars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sculptured every summer delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his halls and chambers out of sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes his tinkling waters slipt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down through a frost-leaved forest-crypt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, sparkling aisles of steel-stemmed trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bending to counterfeit a breeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the roof no fretwork knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But silvery mosses that downward grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quaint arabesques of ice-fern leaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes it was simply smooth and clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the gladness of heaven to shine through, and here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had caught the nodding bulrush-tops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung them thickly with diamond drops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which crystalled the beams of moon and sun,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each flitting shadow of earth and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest the happy model should be lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been mimicked in fairy masonry<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the elfin builders of the frost.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Within the hall are the song and laughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cheeks of Christmas glow red and jolly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sprouting is every corbel and rafter<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the lightsome green of ivy and holly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the deep gulf of the chimney wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wallows the Yule-log's roaring tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad flame-pennons droop and flap<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And belly and tug as a flag in the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a locust shrills the imprisoned sap,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hunted to death in its galleries blind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swift little troops of silent sparks,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Like herds of startled deer."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The elfin builders of the frost have raised even
more delicate structures than the snow. The descriptive
power of the poets in picturing nature's handiwork
cannot be better seen than in these passages.
It is hardly worth while to suggest the points of
resemblance which children will quickly detect in
these passages, as the comparison of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Through the deep gulf of the chimney wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wallows the Yule-log's roaring tide,"<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The merrier up its roaring draught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great throat of the chimney laughed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such passages, suggesting like thoughts in earlier
studies, are very frequent and spring up in unexpected
quarters.</p>

<p>For example, Emerson, in "Waldeinsamkeit,"
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I do not count the hours I spend<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In wandering by the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest is my loyal friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like God it useth me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again, in the "Apology," he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Think me not unkind and rude<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I walk alone in grove and glen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I go to the god of the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To fetch his word to men."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Lowell, in "The Bobolink":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As long, long years ago I wandered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to wander even yet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hours the idle schoolboy squandered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man would die ere he'd forget.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O hours that frosty eld deemed wasted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nodding his gray head toward my books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dearer prize the lore I tasted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With you, among the trees and brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all that I have gained since then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From learned books or study-withered men."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And Whittier says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our uncle, innocent of books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rich in lore of fields and brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ancient teachers never dumb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature's unhoused lyceum."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would not be difficult to recall other passages
from Bryant, Shakespeare, Byron, and many others,
expressing this love of solitude in woods or on the
seashore, and the wisdom to be gained from such
communion with nature. This active retrospect to
gather up kindred thoughts out of previous studies
and mingle them with the newer influx of radiant
ideas from master minds is a fruitful mode of assimilating
and compounding knowledge. It may be
advisable at times for the teacher to bring together
a few additional passages from still wider sources,
expressive of a thought kindred to that worked out
in the class. Such study leads to a self-reliant, enthusiastic
companionship with the thoughts of great
men, and is most profitable.</p>

<p>4. There is a pronounced value in dramatic representation
of literary selections. The impersonating
of characters gives an intensity and realism to the
thought that cannot be effected in any other way.
In some cases it is possible to provide a stage and
some degree of costuming, to lend more complete
realization of the scenes.</p>

<p>In favor of such dramatic efforts it may be said
that children, even in the earlier grades, are naturally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
dramatic, and enjoy greatly both seeing and participating
in them. It gives scope to their natural tendency
toward action, rather than repose, and proper
verbal expression is more easily secured in conjunction
with action than without it. In this connection
it may be said that acting lends greater freedom and
spontaneity to the reading.</p>

<p>Schlegel, in his description of dramatic art, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Even in a lively oral narration, it is not unusual
to introduce persons in conversation with each other,
and to give a corresponding variety to the tone and the
expression. But the gaps, which these conversations
leave in the story, the narrator fills up in his own
name with a description of the accompanying circumstances,
and other particulars. The dramatic poet
must renounce all such expedients; but for this he is
richly recompensed in the following invention. He
requires each of the characters in his story to be personated
by a living individual; that this individual
should, in sex, age, and figure, meet as near as may
be the prevalent conceptions of his fictitious original,
nay, assume his entire personality; that every speech
should be delivered in a suitable tone of voice, and
accompanied by appropriate action and gesture;
and that those external circumstances should be
added which are necessary to give the hearers a
clear idea of what is going forward. Moreover, these
representatives of the creatures of his imagination
must appear in the costume belonging to their as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>sumed
rank, and to their age and country; partly for
the sake of greater resemblance, and partly because,
even in dress, there is something characteristic.
Lastly, he must see them placed in a locality which,
in some degree, resembles that where, according to
his fable, the action took place, because this also contributes
to the resemblance: he places them, <i>i.e.</i>, on a
scene. All this brings us to the idea of the theatre.
It is evident that the very form of dramatic poetry,
that is, the exhibition of an action by dialogue without
the aid of narrative, implies the theatre as its
necessary complement."</p>

<p>"The invention of dramatic art, and of the theatre,
seems a very obvious and natural one. Man has a
great disposition to mimicry; when he enters vividly
into the situation, sentiments, and passions of others,
he involuntarily puts on a resemblance to them in
his gestures. Children are perpetually going out of
themselves; it is one of their chief amusements to
represent those grown people whom they have had
an opportunity of observing, or whatever strikes their
fancy; and with the happy pliancy of their imagination,
they can exhibit all the characteristics of any
dignity they may choose to assume, be it that of a
father, a schoolmaster, or a king."</p>

<p>In his book, "Imagination and Dramatic Instinct,"
S. S. Curry says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since dramatic instinct is so important, the
question naturally arises respecting the use of dia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>logues
for its education. There are those who think
that all histrionic art is useless; that it is even deleterious
to character to assume a part.</p>

<p>"The best answer to this is the study of the little
child. The very first means a child adopts to get out
of itself, or to realize the great world about it, is by
dramatic action and instinct. No child was ever born
with any mind at all, that had not some of this instinct;
and the more promising the child, the more
is it dramatic and imaginative. Dramatic instinct is
universal. It is the secret of all success; it is the instinct
by which man sees things from different points
of view, by which he realizes the ideal in character in
contrast to that which is not ideal."</p>

<p>"Professor Monroe was once asked by a clergyman
for private lessons. He told him that was impossible.
'Well,' said the minister, 'what can I do then?'
'Go home and read Shakespeare dramatically.'
Why was such advice given? Because the struggle to
read Shakespeare would get the minister out of himself.
The struggle to realize how men of different
types of character would speak certain things would
make him conscious whether he, himself, spoke naturally.
He would, in short, become aware of his
mannerisms, of his narrow gamut of emotions, his
sameness of point of view; he would be brought into
direct contact with the process of his own mind in
thinking."</p>

<p>The supreme value of a vivid and versatile imagi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>nation
in giving full and rich development to the whole
mind is now a vital part of our confession of faith.
The question is how to cultivate such a resourceful
imagination. The literature of the creative imagination
is felt to be the chief means, and the dramatic
instinct toward interpreting, assimilating and expressing
human thought and feeling opens the avenue of
growth.</p>

<p>Dr. Curry says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dramatic instinct should be trained because it is
a part of the imagination, because it gives us practical
steps toward the development of the imagination,
because it is the means of securing discipline and
power over feeling. Dramatic instinct should be
trained because it is the insight of one mind into another.
The man who has killed his dramatic instinct
has become unsympathetic, and can never appreciate
any one's point of view but his own. Dramatic
instinct endows us with broad conceptions of the
idiosyncrasies, beliefs, and convictions of men. It
trains us to unconscious reasoning, to a deep insight
into the motives of man. It is universally felt that
one's power to 'other himself' is the measure of the
greatness of his personality. All sympathy, all
union of ourselves with the ideals and struggles of
our race, are traceable to imagination and dramatic
instinct."</p>

<p>He further emphasizes the idea that dramatic instinct
has two elements&mdash;imagination and sympathy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
"Imagination affords insight into character; sympathy
enables us to identify ourselves with it." "Together
they form the chief elements of altruism.
They redeem the mind from narrowness and selfishness;
they enable the individual to appreciate the
point of view, the feelings, motives, and characters of
his fellow-men; they open his eyes to read the
various languages of human art; they enable him to
commune with his kind on a higher plane than that of
commonplace facts; they lift him into communion with
the art and spirit of every age and nation. Without
their development man is excluded from the highest
enjoyment, the highest communion with his kind, and
from the highest success in every walk of life."</p>

<p>Dramatization is the only means by which we can
bring the reading work of the school to its full and
natural expression. The action involved in it predisposes
the mind to full and natural utterance. The fulfilment
of all the dramatic conditions lends an impetus
and genuineness to every word that is spoken. It
has been often observed that boys and girls whose
reading is somewhat expressionless become direct
and forcible when taking a part in a dialogue or
dramatic action. It would be almost farcical not to
put force and meaning into the words when all the
other elements of action and realism are present.</p>

<p>Educational progress is everywhere exerting a
distinct pressure at those points where greater realism,
deeper absorption in actualities, is possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
This is the significance of outdoor excursions, of
experiments, laboratories, and object work in nature
study. In geography and history it is the purpose
of pictures, vivid descriptions, biographical stories, and
the accounts of eye-witnesses and real travellers, etc.</p>

<p>In literature we possess, embodied in striking
concrete personalities, many of the most forcible
ideas that men have conceived and dealt with in
the history of the world. It is very desirable that
children should become themselves the vehicles for
the expression of these ideas. The school is the
place where children should become the embodiment
of ideas. It would be a grand and not impractical
scheme of education to propose to make
the school a place where each child, in a well-chosen
succession, should be allowed to impersonate
and become the embodiment of the constructive
ideas of our civilization.</p>

<p>We reason much concerning the educative value
of carpentry, of the various forms of manual skill in
wood and iron, of weaving, gardening, and cooking,
of the work of shoemaker, basket-maker, and potter,
and of the educative value of these constructive
activities; for the purposes of universal education,
is it not of equal importance that children become
skilled in the histrionic art, in the apt interpretation
and expression of good manners, in that deeper
social insight and versatile tact which are the constructive
elements in conduct? Or, putting it in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
more obvious form, is it any more important for
a person to know how to construct a bookcase or
even a steam-engine, than to shape his speech or
conduct skilfully in meeting a board of education
or a business manager.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of the school to educate
players or public readers, any more than to train
carpenters or machinists. But the reading exercises
in school should culminate in the ability to sympathetically
interpret a considerable variety of human
life and character as presented in our best literature.
Modern educators, however, are not satisfied, in any
important study, with theoretical knowledge derived
from books. They demand that knowledge shall
pass over into some sort of practice and use. Reading
passes naturally and without a break from the
interpretation of life to its embodiment in conduct.
In this important respect it is the most practical
of all studies. Its subject matter, derived from
literature, consists largely of an interesting variety
of typical and artistically beautiful character delineations
from the hands of the supreme master of this
art. Dramatic representation is the last and indispensable
step in the art of reading; and the interest
that naturally attaches to it, from early childhood
up through all the stages of growth, removes one
chief obstacle to its introduction.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that wisdom, skill, and versatility
in conduct are the natural and appropriate outcome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of successful dramatic representation, it is not at
all extravagant to say that the average child will
have far more use for this result, both now and in all
the vicissitudes of later life, than for skill in carpentry,
or ironwork, or weaving, etc.</p>

<p>Nor have we any disposition to detract from the
value usually attributed to manual training in its
various forms by its advocates.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for teachers generally to employ
the dialogue form when the selection admits of it, and
to assign the parts to different children. Our purpose,
however, in the fuller discussion and emphasis of the
dramatic element is to suggest a more liberal employment
of dramatic selections, and to provide for a much
fuller dramatic representation, using simple, inexpensive
costumes and stage surroundings where possible.</p>

<p>When we examine in detail the number of dramatic
selections in a set of readers, or among the masterpieces
sometimes read in the classes below the high
school, we shall find a number of purely dramatic
works. "The Merchant of Venice" and "Julius
C&aelig;sar" are well adapted to seventh and eighth
grades, and there are many selections in which
the dialogue is an important feature, as in "The
Cricket on the Hearth," "King of the Golden River,"
"Tanglewood Tales," "Lady of the Lake," "Marmion,"
"Pilgrim's Progress," "Grandfather's Chair,"
and many others.</p>

<p>"The Courtship of Miles Standish" has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
published in a form specially adapted for school
exhibitions by Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co. Longfellow's
"Giles Corey of the Salem Farms," in the "Riverside
Series," is a drama well suited to sixth grade. The
story of "William Tell," derived from Schiller's
drama, is adapted to sixth and possibly to fifth grade.</p>

<p>Some of the ballads are cast in the form of the
dialogue, and can be easily treated so in the school,
as "Proud Lady Margaret," "Robin Hood and the
Widow's Sons," "King John and the Abbot of Canterbury,"
and many others. The Robin Hood stories
are full of dialogue and could be easily dramatized,
and so with "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and others.</p>

<p>An examination of our literature from this point
of view will discover a strong dramatic element in
a large portion of it, and the cultivation of this spirit
will qualify the children for a better appreciation of
many of the great works.</p>

<p>5. Treatment of the "Odyssey."</p>

<p>The "Odyssey" is probably as well known as any
masterpiece in the world's literature. For the sake
of illustration, therefore, we will enter upon a brief
discussion of the mode of handling it as a unit in the
school.</p>

<p>There are abundant sources in English from
which the teacher can get an adequate knowledge
of this great poem without using the original Greek.
A few of the leading books which the teacher may
consult are as follows: "The Story of Ulysses"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
(Cook). A very simple, abbreviated narrative of
Ulysses' wanderings, sometimes used as a reading
book in fourth or fifth grade. (Public School
Publishing Co.)&mdash;"Lamb's Adventures of Ulysses."
A pleasing prose rendering of the chief incidents of
the story, more difficult than the preceding. Sometimes
used as a reader. (Ginn &amp; Co.)&mdash;"Church's
Stories of the Old World," in which "The Adventures
of Ulysses" forms a chapter. A good short
treatment of the story in simple language. (Ginn &amp;
Co.)&mdash;"Ulysses among the Ph&aelig;acians," consisting
of selections from five books of the "Odyssey" as
translated into verse by Bryant. This seems well
adapted for use as a reading-book in fourth or fifth
grade, and will be discussed more fully as such.
(Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co.)&mdash;"The Odyssey of
Homer" by Palmer, is an excellent prose-poetic
rendering of the whole poem, and is of great service
to the teacher. (Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co.)&mdash;Another
excellent prose translation, by Butcher and
Lang, has been much used. (The Macmillan Co.)&mdash;Bryant's
"Homer's 'Odyssey,'" a complete poetic
rendering of the whole twenty-four books of the
poem, is probably the best basis for school reference
and study of the poem.&mdash;"National Epics," by
Rabb, has a good narrative and introduction for the
"Odyssey," and a list of critical references. (A. C.
McClurg &amp; Co.)&mdash;"Art and Humanity in Homer,"
by Lawton, has an interesting discussion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"Odyssey." Other famous translations of the whole
"Odyssey" were made by Alexander Pope, William
Cowper, George Chapman, and others.</p>

<p>It is not unusual in schools for teachers to give
children of the third or fourth grade an oral introduction
to the whole story in a series of lessons. This
requires skill in presenting and discussing the
episodes, and should be attended by good oral reproductions
by the children. Such oral work should be
done in distinct lessons apart from the regular reading.
Later, in fourth or fifth grade, the story is
sometimes read in class from one of the simple prose
narratives of Miss Cook, or Lamb, or Church. In
the fifth or sixth grade, "Ulysses among the Ph&aelig;acians"
forms an interesting reading-book, with which
to acquaint the children more fully with the poetic
beauty and descriptive detail of the original, so far
as it can be secured in English. In connection with
such reading it may be interesting to choose from
Bryant's complete translation other selected parts of
the story, and encourage the children to read them,
if books from the library or homes can be provided.</p>

<p>We may dwell for a moment upon those qualities of
Homer's story which have commanded the admiration
of the great poets in different ages and countries.
The peculiar poetic charm and power of the original
Greek are probably untranslatable, although several
eminent poets have attempted it. But we have at
least both prose and verse renderings of it that are
beautiful and poetic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the critics have said that the whole poem
is a perfect unit in thought,&mdash;much more so than the
"Iliad,"&mdash;centring in the person of Ulysses. His
wanderings and his final return constitute the thread
of the narrative. In the main it is a story of peace,
with descriptions of cities, islands, palaces, strange
lands, and peaceful arts and manners. After their
return from Troy we meet Nestor and Menelaus,
dwelling happily in their palaces and surrounded
with home comforts. Ulysses, himself, the great
sufferer, is tossed about the world, or held captive
on sea-girt, far-away islands. He passes through a
series of wonderful adventures, keeping his alertness
and balance of mind so completely that his name has
become a synonym in all lands for shrewdness and
far-seeing wisdom. And it is not only a wise perception,
but a self-control in the midst of old and new
temptations which is most remarkable. This over-mastering
shrewdness or calculation even overdoes
itself and becomes amusing, when he tries, for
example, to deceive his guardian goddess as to who
he is. The descriptions of women and of domestic
life are famous and delightful. The constancy of
Penelope, her industry and shrewdness in outwitting
the suitors, have given her a supreme place among
the women of story. The descriptions of peaceful
manners and customs, of public games, of feasting
and music, of palace halls and ornament, are among
the great literary pictures of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The particular adventures through which Ulysses
passed with Circe, with the Sirens, with Polyphemus,
with Eolus, with the lotus-eaters, and others, are
plainly suggestive of the dangers which threaten the
thoughtless minded, those who plunge headlong into
danger without forethought. Ulysses does not give
way to folly or passion, is bold and skilful in danger,
and persevering to the last extreme.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the "Odyssey," the teacher
will need a general knowledge of Greek mythology,
which can be easily derived from "Greek Gods,
Heroes, and Men" (Scott, Foresman, &amp; Co.), and
from several other of the reference books. Some
study of Greek architecture, sculpture, and modes of
life will be instructive and helpful, as given in Smith's
"History of Greece" and other histories. Pictures of
Greek temples and ruins, sculpture, and palaces will
be pleasing and attractive to children. (See L&uuml;bke's
"History of Art," Vol. I, Dodd, Mead, &amp; Co.) Some
of the children's books also contain good pictures.</p>

<p>A good map, indicating the supposed wanderings
of Ulysses in the Mediterranean, is given in several
of the books, <i>e.g.</i> in Palmer's "Odyssey," and fixes
many of the most interesting events of the story.
The teacher should not overlook the geography of
the story and its relation to this and later studies in
history, literature, and geography.</p>

<p>In using "Ulysses among the Ph&aelig;acians" as a
reader in fourth or fifth grade, the first unit of study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
is the voyage of Ulysses on his raft, from the time
of leaving Calypso till he is wrecked by the storm
and driven upon the island of Scheria, the home of
the Ph&aelig;acians. We will suggest a few points in
the treatment. The supposed places and the route
of the voyage can be traced on the map. Let the
teacher sketch it on the board in assigning the lesson.
Suggest that the children locate in the sky the stars
and constellations by which Ulysses is to direct his
course. The story of the construction of the raft on
which Ulysses is to make this journey, just preceding
this part of the story, could be read to the class by
the teacher, as it is not contained in these extracts.
In length of time how does this voyage compare
with a voyage across the Atlantic to-day? Why is it
said, in line 329, that the Great Bear "alone dips not
into the waters of the deep"?</p>

<p>From previous studies, the children may be able
to tell of Ulysses' stay upon the island with Calypso.
What may the children know of Neptune? Why is
he angered with Ulysses? A picture of Neptune
with the trident is in place. Explain the expression
"while from above the night fell suddenly." Was
Ulysses justified in saying, "Now must I die a miserable
death"? In spite of the desperate storm, in
what ways does Ulysses struggle to save his life?
How do the gods assist him? In what way does
this experience of Ulysses remind us of Robinson
Crusoe's shipwreck and escape?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>With how many men had Ulysses started on his
way to Troy? Now he alone escapes after great
suffering and hopeless buffetings. In what way
during this voyage and shipwreck did Ulysses display
his accustomed shrewdness and foresight? After
landing, what dangers did he still fear?</p>

<p>The nearly three hundred lines of Book V, which
give this account of Ulysses' voyage and shipwreck,
will require several lessons, and the above questions
are but a few of those raised in its reading and discussion.
When Neptune, Ulysses, or Ino speak, let
the speaker be impersonated so as to give greater
force and reality. In the next book (VI), there is
more of dialogue and better opportunity for variety
of manner and voice.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to enter into further detail
suggesting questions. But we may believe that a
spirited treatment of this part of the story of Ulysses
in reading lessons, including his stay and treatment
among the Ph&aelig;acians, will give the children much
appreciation of the beauty and power of this old
story. By means of occasional readings of other
selected parts of the "Odyssey," from Bryant or
Palmer, some of the most striking pictures in the
story of his wanderings can be presented. Even
the children may find time for some of this additional,
outside reading. In any event the story of
Ulysses, as a piece of great literature, can thus be
brought home to the understandings and hearts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
children, and will constitute henceforward a part
of that rich furniture of the mind which we call
culture.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POINTS IN READING</h3>

<p>1. The teacher's effort is first directed to a vivid
interpretation of the author's thought and feeling,
and later to an expressive rendering of the thought.</p>

<p>2. Every exertion should be made to lead the
children to an absorbed and interested attention in
the selections.</p>

<p>3. The author's leading motive in the whole selection
should be firmly grasped by the teacher. By
centring all discussion toward this motive, unnecessary
digressions will be avoided.</p>

<p>4. The teacher will hardly teach well unless he
has saturated himself with the spirit of the selection,
and enjoys it. To this end he needs not only to
study the selection, but also the historical, geographical,
biographical, and other side-lights.</p>

<p>5. The teacher needs great freedom and versatility
in the use of his materials. Warmth, animation,
and freedom of manner are necessary.</p>

<p>6. Children often do not know how to study a
reading lesson. In the assignment and in the way of
handling the lesson they should be taught how to get
at it, how to understand and enjoy it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>7. In the assignment of the lesson the thought
of the piece should be opened up in an interesting
way, and such difficulties as children are not likely to
grapple with and master for themselves pointed out
and approached.  Difficult words need to be pronounced
and hard passages explained.</p>

<p>8. The assignment should be unmistakably clear
and definite, so as to insure a good seat study.</p>

<p>9. The seat study should be chiefly on parts
already discussed in class.</p>

<p>10. During the recitation proper, strong class attention
by all the members of the class is a first
necessity. Much knowledge, alertness, and skill are
necessary to secure this. One must keep all the
members of the class in the eye constantly, and
distribute the questions and work among them
promptly and judiciously, so as to secure concentrated
effort.</p>

<p>11. The teacher can often judge a recitation better
without looking at the book while the class is reading.</p>

<p>12. Skill in questioning is very useful in reading
lessons.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) Questions to arouse the thought should
appeal to the experience of children.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Questions to bring out the meaning of
words or passages, or to expose errors or
to develop thought, should be clear and
specific, not long and ambiguous.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Let the teacher be satisfied with reasonable
answers, and not insist on the precise verbal form
present to his own mind.</p>

<p>14. The teacher needs to awaken strongly the
imagination in picturing scenes, in interpreting
poetic images and figures, and in impersonating
characters. The picture-forming power is stimulated
by apt questions, by suggestion of the teacher, by
interpretation, by appeal to experience, by dramatic
action.</p>

<p>15. The use of the dialogue and dramatic representation
is among the best means of awakening
interest and producing freedom and self-forgetfulness.</p>

<p>16. The pupil should give his own interpretation,
subject to correction, and interpret parts in relation
to the whole.</p>

<p>17. Without too much loss of time children should
learn to help themselves in overcoming difficulties
in solving problems.</p>

<p>18. Sometimes it is well for children to come prepared
to ask definite questions on parts they do not
understand.</p>

<p>19. The tendency to more independent and mature
thinking is encouraged by comparing similar ideas,
figures of speech, and language in different poems
and from different authors.</p>

<p>20. There should be much effective reading and
not much mere oral reproduction. The paraphrase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
may be used at times to give the pupil a larger view
of the content of the piece.</p>

<p>21. Let the pupil reading feel responsible for giving
to the class the content of the printed page.
Often it is best to face the class.</p>

<p>22. The teacher should occasionally read a passage
in the best style for the pupils, not for direct
imitation, but to suggest the higher ideals and spirit
of good reading. A high standard is thus set up.</p>

<p>23. Children should be encouraged to learn by
heart the passages they like. In the midst of the
recitation it is well occasionally to memorize a passage.</p>

<p>24. The teacher must drill himself in clear-cut
enunciation of short vowels, final consonants, and
pure vowel sounds. Cultivate also a quick ear for
accurate enunciation in the pupils and for pleasing
tones. Frequent drill exercise, singly and in concert,
is necessary.</p>

<p>25. Use ingenuity by indirect methods to overcome
nasality, stuttering, nervously rapid reading,
slovenly and careless expression, monotone, and singsong.</p>

<p>26. By means of physical training, deep breathing,
vigorous thought work, encourage to self-reliant
manner and good physical position.</p>

<p>27. Give variety to each lesson; avoid monotony
and humdrum.</p>

<p>28. Each lesson should emphasize a particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
aim, determined by the nature of the selection or by
the previous bad habits and faults of the children
in reading. It is impossible to give proper emphasis
to all things in each lesson, and indefiniteness and
monotony are the result.</p>

<h3>THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER</h3>


<p>In discussing the value and fruitfulness of this
field of study to children, it is impossible to forbear
the suggestion of its scope and significance for
teachers. If the masters of song and expression
are able to work so strongly upon the immature
minds of children, how much deeper the influence
upon the mature and thoughtful minds of teachable
teachers! They above all others should have dispositions
receptive of the best educational influences.
The duties and experiences of their daily work predispose
them toward an earnest and teachable spirit.
In very many cases, therefore, their minds are wide
open to the reception of the best. And how deep
and wide and many-sided is this enfranchisement of
the soul through literature!</p>

<p>It is a gateway to history; not, however, that castaway
shell which our text-books, in the form of a dull
recital of facts, call history; but its heart and soul,
the living, breathing men and women, the source
and incentive of great movements and struggles
toward the light. Literature does not make the
study of history superfluous, but it puts a purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
into history which lies deeper than the facts, it sifts
out the wheat from the chaff, casts aside the superficial
and accidental, and gets down into the deep
current of events where living causes are at work.</p>

<p>The "Courtship of Miles Standish," for example,
is deeper and stronger than history because it idealizes
the stern and rigid qualities of the Puritan, while
John Alden and Priscilla touch a deeper universal
sympathy, and body forth in forms of beauty that
pulsing human love which antedates the Puritan and
underlies all forms of religion and society.</p>

<p>Illustrative cases have been given in sufficient
abundance to show that literature, among other
things, has a strong political side. It grasps with
a master hand those questions which involve true
patriotism. It exalts them into ideals, and fires the
hearts of the people to devotion and sacrifice for
their fulfilment.</p>

<p>Burke's "Oration on the American War" is, to one
who has studied American history, an astonishing
confirmation of how righteous and far-sighted were
the principles for which Samuel Adams and the
other patriots struggled at the opening of the Revolution.
Webster's speech at Bunker Hill is a graphic
and fervent retrospect on the past of a great struggle,
and a prophetic view of the swelling tide of individual,
social, and national well-being.</p>

<p>If the teacher is to interpret history to school
children, he must learn to grasp what is essential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and vital; he must be able to discriminate between
those events which are trivial and those of lasting
concern. The study of our best American literature
will reveal to him this distinction, and make him a
keen and comprehensive critic of political affairs.</p>

<p>Barnett, in his "Common Sense in Education and
Teaching" (p. 170), says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the second place, literature provides us with
historical landmarks. We cannot be said to understand
the general 'history' of a particular time unless
we know something of the thought that stirred its
most subtle thinkers, and interpreted and made articulate
the spirit of the times in which they lived. The
most notable facts in the history of the times of
Edward III, of Elizabeth, and of Victoria are that
Chaucer and Shakespeare and Tennyson and their
contemporaries lived and wrote. Political history,
social history, economic history, even ecclesiastical history,
are all reflected, illustrated, and interpreted by
what we find in the great works of contemporary
literature."</p>

<p>Charles Kingsley, in his "Literary and General
Essays" (p. 249), holds a like opinion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I said that the ages of history were analogous to
the ages of man, and that each age of literature was
the truest picture of the history of its day, and for
this very reason English literature is the best, perhaps
the only, teacher of English history, to women
especially. For it seems to me that it is principally by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the help of such an extended literary course that we
can cultivate a just and enlarged taste which will connect
education with the deepest feelings of the heart."</p>

<p>Literature is also a mirror that reflects many sides
of social life and usage. There is no part of a
teacher's education that is so vital to his practical
success as social culture. John Locke's "Thoughts
on Education" are, in the main, an inquiry into the
methods and means by which an English gentleman
can be formed. The aim of the tutor who has this
difficult task is not chiefly to give learning, to fill the
mind with information, to develop mentality, but to
train the practical judgment in harmony with gentlemanly
conduct. The tutor, himself a scholar, is to
know the world, its ins and outs, its varieties of social
distinction and usage, its snares and pitfalls, its wise
men and fools. The child is to learn to look the
world in the face and understand it, to know himself
and to be master of himself and of his conduct, to
appreciate other people in their moods and characters,
and to adapt himself prudently and with tact to the
practical needs. The gentleman whom Locke sets
up as his ideal is not a fashion-plate figure, not a
drawing-room gallant, but a clear-headed man who
understands other people and himself, and has been
led by insensible degrees to so shape his habitual
conduct as most wisely to answer his needs in the
real world. Emerson, with all his lofty idealism and
unconventionalism, has an ideal of education nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
akin to that of Locke. This social ideal of Locke
and Emerson is one that American teachers can well
afford to ponder. As a nation, we have been accustomed
to think that a certain amount of roughness
and boorishness was necessary as a veil to cover the
strongest manly qualities. Smoothness and tact and
polish, however successful they may be in real life,
are, theoretically at least, at a discount. The Adamses,
Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Thoreau, were men who
did violence in a good many ways to social usages,
and we may admire their faults overmuch.</p>

<p>To the teacher who stands in the presence of thirty
or fifty distinct species of incipient men and women,
social insight and culture, the ability to appreciate
each in his individual traits, his strength or weakness,
are a prime essential to good educative work.</p>

<p>Now, there are two avenues through which social
culture is attainable,&mdash;contact with men and women
in the social environment which envelops us all, and
literature. Literature is, first of all, a hundred-sided
revelation of human conduct as springing from motive.
Irving, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Holmes, and Lowell
are revealers of humanity. Still more so are Dickens
and Eliot and Shakespeare and Goethe. To study
these authors is not simply to enjoy the graphic
power of an artist, but to look into the lives of so
many varieties of men and women. They lay bare
the heart and its inward promptings. Our appreciation
for many forms of life under widely differing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
conditions is awakened. We come in touch with
those typical varieties of men and women whom we
shall daily meet if we will but notice. It broadens
one's perceptions and sympathies, it reveals the
many-sidedness of human life. It suggests to a
teacher that the forty varieties of humanity in her
schoolroom are not after one pattern, nor to be
manipulated according to a single device.</p>

<p>The social life that surrounds each one of us is
small and limited. Our intimate companionships are
few, and we can see deeply into the inner life of but
a small portion even of those about us. The deeper
life of thought and feeling is largely covered up with
conventionalities and externalities. But in the works
of the best novelists, dramatists, and poets, we may
look abroad into the whole world of time and place,
upon an infinite variety of social conditions, and we
are permitted to see directly into the inner thought
and motive, the very soul of the actors. Yet fidelity
to human nature and real life is claimed to be the
peculiar merit of these great writers. By the common
consent of critics, Shakespeare is the prince of
character delineators. Schlegel says of him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shakespeare's knowledge of mankind has become
proverbial; in this his superiority is so great that he
has justly been called the master of the human heart.
A readiness to remark the mind's fainter and involuntary
utterances, and the power to express with certainty
the meaning of these signs, as determined by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
experience and reflection, constitute 'the observer of
men.'"</p>

<p>"After all, a man acts so because he is so. And
what each man is, that Shakespeare reveals to us
most immediately; he demands and obtains our belief,
even for what is singular and deviates from the
ordinary course of nature. Never perhaps was there
so comprehensive a talent for characterization as
Shakespeare. It not only grasps every diversity of
rank, age, and sex, down to the lispings of infancy;
not only do the king and the beggar, the hero and
the pickpocket, the sage and the idiot, speak and act
with equal truthfulness; not only does he transport
himself to distant ages and foreign nations, and portray
with the greatest accuracy (a few apparent violations
of costume excepted) the spirit of the ancient
Romans, of the French in the wars with the English,
of the English themselves during a great part of their
history, of the Southern Europeans (in the serious
part of many comedies), the cultivated society of the
day, and the rude barbarism of a Norman foretime;
his human characters have not only such depth and
individuality that they do not admit of being classed
under common names, and are inexhaustible even in
conception,&mdash;no, this Prometheus not merely forms
men, he opens the gates of the magical world of
spirits."</p>

<p>What is true of Shakespeare in a pre&euml;minent
degree is true to a marked extent of all the great
novelists and poets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The teacher needs to possess great versatility and
tact in social situations. A quick insight, social
ease, freedom, and self-possession are of the first
importance to him. The power of sympathy, of
appreciation for others' feelings and difficulties, is
wholly dependent upon such social cultivation.
Otherwise the teacher will be rude, even uncouth
and boorish in manner, producing friction and ill-will
where tact and gentleness would bring sympathy
and confidence. Many people absorb this refinement
of thought and manner from the social circles
with which they mingle, and it is, of course, a smiling
fortune that has placed a teacher's early life in
a happy and cultured atmosphere, where the social
sympathies and graces are absorbed almost unconsciously.
But even where the earlier conditions
have been less favorable, the opportunity for rapid
social development and culture is most promising.
The numberless cases in our country in which young
people, by the strength of their energetic purpose
and desire for improvement, have raised themselves
not only to superior knowledge and scholarship, but
also to that far greater refinement of social life and
manner which we call true culture,&mdash;the numberless
instances of this sort are a surprising indication of
the power of education. Literature has been a
potent agent in this direction. It emancipates, it
sets free, the spirit of man. It lifts him above what
is sordid and material, and gives him those true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
standards of worth with which to measure all things.
It contains within itself the refining elements, the
&aelig;sthetic and ethical ideals, and, best of all, it portrays
human life in all its thought, feeling, and
passion with such intensity and realistic fidelity that
its teaching power is unparalleled.</p>

<p>This potentiality of the better literature to produce
such noble results in the higher range of culture is
dependent upon conditions. No one will understand
literature who does not study and understand ordinary
life as it surrounds him; who does not constantly
draw upon his own experience in interpreting
the characters portrayed in books. No stupid or
unobservant person will be made wise through books,
be they never so choice. Even the student who
works laboriously at his text-books, but has no eye
nor care for the people or doings about him, is getting
only the mechanical side of education, and is
losing the better part. He who will draw riches out
of books must put his intellect and sympathy, his
whole enthusiastic better self, into them.</p>

<p>The indwelling virtue of great books is that they
demand this intense awakening, this complete absorption
of the whole self. The mind of a child and of
a man or woman has to stretch itself to the utmost
limit to take in the message of a great writer. One
feels the old barriers giving way and the mind expanding
to the conception of larger things. Speaking
of the ancient drama at Athens, Shelley says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
"The imagination is enlarged by a sympathy with
pains and passions so mighty that they distend in
their conception the capacity of that by which they
are conceived."</p>

<p>Those who have received into the inner self the
expansive energy of noble thought and social culture,
are the better qualified, from the rich variety of the
inner life, to act effectively upon the complex conditions
and forces of the outer world. The teacher
whose inner life is teeming with these rich sympathies
and potent ideals will react with greater prudence
and tact upon the kaleidoscopic conditions of
a school.</p>

<p>Practical social life and literature are not distinct
modes of culture. They are one, they interact upon
each other in scores of ways. Give a teacher social
opportunities, give him the best of our literature, let
these two work their full influence upon him,&mdash;then,
if he cannot become a teacher, it is a hopeless case.
Let him go to the shop, to the farm, to the legislature;
there is no place for him in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Literature is also a sharp and caustic critic of his
own follies or foibles, to one who can reflect. It has
a multitude of surprises by which we are able, as
Burns wished,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To see oursels as ithers see us."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even the schoolmaster finds an occasional apt description
of himself in literature which it is often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
interesting and entertaining for him to ponder. One
of the most familiar is that of Goldsmith in "The
Deserted Village":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village master taught his little school.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man severe he was, and stern to view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew him well, and every truant knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day's disasters in his morning face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well they laugh'd, with counterfeited glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well the busy whisper, circling round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love he bore to learning was in fault.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village all declar'd how much he knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even the story ran that he could gauge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arguing, too, the parson own'd his skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For even though vanquish'd he could argue still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While words of learned length and thundering sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amaz'd the gazing rustics ranged around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still they gaz'd, and still the wonder grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one small head could carry all he knew."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A like entertainment and suggestion of what the
schoolmaster may be, as seen by others, are furnished
by Irving's Ichabod Crane. William Shenstone's
description of the schoolmistress and the
school near two hundred years ago in his native
village, is very diverting. Charles Dickens's descrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>tion
of schools and schoolmasters is important in
the history of England, and, like his portrayals
of child life generally, of deep pedagogical worth
to teachers.</p>

<p>In his book, "The Schoolmaster in Literature,"
Mr. Skinner has done a real service to the teaching
world in bringing together, into a convenient compilation
from many sources, the literature bearing
directly upon the schoolmaster. Even the comic
representations and caricatures are valuable in calling
attention to common foibles and mannerisms, to
say nothing of the more serious faults of teachers.</p>

<p>It is in literature, also, and in those lives and
scenes from history which literary artists have
worked up, that the teacher can best develop his
own moral ideals and strengthen the groundwork of
his own moral character. The stream will not rise
above its source, and a teacher's moral influence in
a school will not reach above the inspirations from
high sources which he himself has felt. Those
teachers who have devoted themselves solely to the
mastery of the texts they teach, who have read little
from our best writers, are drawing upon a slender
capital of moral resource. Not even if home influences
have laid a sound basis of moral habits are
these sufficient reserves for the exigencies of teaching.
The moral nature of the teacher needs constant
stimulus to upward growing, and the children
need examples, ideal illustrations, life and blood im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>personations
of the virtues; and literature is the chief
and only safe reservoir from which to draw them.</p>

<p>We have already discussed the moral value of the
right books for children. The lessons of the great
works are so profound in this respect that they offer
a still wider range of study to the teacher. Even
the foremost thinkers and philosophers have found
therein an inexhaustible source of truth and wisdom.</p>

<p>In the Foreword to his "Great Books as Life
Teachers," Newell Dwight Hillis says, "For some
reason our generation has closed its text-books on
ethics and morals, and opened the great poems,
essays, and novels." This is a remarkable statement
and is the key-note to a silent but sweeping change
in education. He adds, "Doubtless for thoughtful
persons this fact argues, not a decline of interest in
the fundamental principles of right living, but a
desire to study these principles as they are made
flesh and embodied in living persons." Again, "It
seems important to remember that the great novelists
are consciously or unconsciously teachers of
morals, while the most fascinating essays and poems
are essentially books of aspiration and spiritual
culture."</p>

<p>It is suggestive to note that this fundamental text
is worked out in his book by chapters on Ruskin's
"Seven Lamps of Architecture," George Eliot's
"Romola," Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter," Victor
Hugo's "Les Miserables," Tennyson's "Idylls of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the King," and Browning's "Saul." This suggests
a fruitful line of studies for every teacher.</p>

<p>Among modern essayists, Emerson, Carlyle, Ruskin,
and Matthew Arnold stand pre&euml;minent, and they
are already well established among the mightiest
teachers of our age, and it may be, of many to
come. Sure it is that teachers could not do better
than put themselves within earshot of these resonant
voices. Their heart-strings will vibrate and
their intellects will be stretched to a full tension,
not simply by the music, but by the truth which
surges up and bursts into utterance. It is scarcely
a figure of speech to say that the lightning flashes
across their pages. The stinging rebuke of wrong,
the noble ideals of righteousness, place them among
the prophets whose tongues have been touched with
fire from the altar.</p>

<p>Besides the historical, social, and moral tuition for
teachers in literature, there are several other important
culture effects in it. The deepest religious incentives
are touched, nature in her myriad phases is
observed with the eye of the poet and scientist, and
the &aelig;sthetic side of poetry and rhythmic prose, its
charm and graces of style, its music and eloquence,
work their influence upon the reader. Literature is
a harp of many strings, and happy is that teacher
who has learned to detect its tones and overtones,
who has listened with pleasure to its varied raptures,
and has felt that expansion of soul which it produces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Literature, in the sense in which we have been
using it, has been called the literature of power, the
literature of the spirit. That is, it has generative,
spiritual life. It is not simple knowledge, it is
knowledge energized, charged with potency. It is
knowledge into which the poet has breathed the
breath of life. The difference between bare knowledge
and the literature of power is like the difference
between a perfect statue in stone and a living,
pulsing, human form.</p>

<p>One of the virtues of literature, therefore, is the
mental stimulus, the joy, the awakening, the intensity
of thought it spontaneously calls forth. Textbooks
are usually a bore, but literature is a natural
resource even in hours of weariness. Who would
dream of enlivening leisure hours or vacation rest
with text-books of grammar, or arithmetic, or history,
or science? But the poet soothes with music,
solemn or gay, according to our choice. If we go to
the woods or lakes to escape our friends, we take one
of the masters of song with us. After a day of toil
and weariness, we can turn to "Evangeline," or
"Lady of the Lake," or the "Vision of Sir Launfal,"
and soon we are listening to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">or the echo of the hunter's horn,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The deep-mouthed bloodhound's heavy bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resounded up the rocky way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faint, from farther distance borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were heard the clanging hoof and horn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At a time when we are not fit for the irksome and
perfunctory preparation of text-book lessons, we are
still capable of receiving abundant entertainment or
hearty inspiration from Warner's "How I killed a
Bear," or Tennyson's "Enoch Arden," or "Sleepy
Hollow." Literature is recreation in its double
sense. It gives rest and relief, and it builds up.</p>

<p>Teachers should shake themselves free from the
conviction that severe disciplinary studies are the
best part of education. They have their well-merited
place. But there are higher spiritual fountains
from which to draw. Read the lives of Scott,
Macaulay, Irving, Hawthorne, and Emerson, and
discover that the things we do with the greatest
inward spontaneity and pleasure and ease are often
the best.</p>

<p>Literature, both in prose and verse, is what the
teacher needs, because our best authors are our
best teachers in their method of handling their subjects.
They know how to find access to the reader's
mind by making their ideas attractive, interesting,
and beautiful. They seem to know how to sharpen
the edge of truth to render it more keen and incisive.
They drive truth deeper, so that it remains
embedded in the life and thought. Let a poet clothe
an idea with strength and wing it with fancy, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
will find its way straight to the heart. First of all,
nearly all our classic writers, especially those we
use in the grades, handle their subjects from the
concrete, graphic, picturesque side. They not only
illustrate abundantly from nature and real things in
life; they nearly always individualize and personify
their ideas. Virtue to a poet is nothing unless it
is impersonated. A true poet is never abstract or
dry or formal in his treatment of a subject. It is
natural for a literary artist, whether in verse or prose,
to create pictures, to put all his ideas into life forms
and bring them close to the real ones in nature.
Homer's idea of wisdom is Minerva, war is Mars,
strength is Ajax, skill and prudence are Ulysses,
faithfulness is Penelope. Dickens does not talk about
schoolmasters in general, but of Squeers. Shakespeare's
idea of jealousy is not a definition, not a
formula, but Othello. Those books which have
enthralled the world, like "Robinson Crusoe," "Pilgrim's
Progress," "Gulliver's Travels," "Arabian
Nights," "Evangeline," "Ivanhoe," "Merchant of
Venice,"&mdash;they deal with no form of classified or
generalized knowledge; they give us no definitions,
they are scenes from real life. They stand among
realities, and their roots are down in the soil of
things. They are persons hemmed in by the close
environment of facts.</p>

<p>This realism, this objectifying of thought, this living
form of knowledge, is characteristic of all great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
writers in prose or verse. The novelist, the romancer,
the poet, the orator, and even the essayist, will always
put the breath of reality into his work by an infusion
of concreteness, of graphic personification. The
poet's fancy, building out of the abundant materials
of sense-experience, is what gives color and warmth
to all his thoughts. Strong writers make incessant
use of figures of speech. Their thought must clothe
itself with the whole panoply of imagery and graphic
representation in order to be efficient in the warfare
for truth.</p>

<p>What a lesson for the teacher! What models upon
which to develop his style of thinking! If the teaching
profession and its work could be weighed in the
balance, the scale would fall on the side of the
abstract with a heavy thud. Not that object lessons
will save us. They only parody the truth. For the
object lesson as a separate thing we have no use at
all. But to ground every idea and every study in
realism, to pass up steadily through real objects and
experience to a perception of truths which have wide
application, to science&mdash;this is the true philosophy
of teaching.</p>

<p>The classic writers lead us even one grand step
beyond realism. The fancy builds better than the
cold reason. It adorns and ennobles thought till it
becomes full-fledged for the flight toward the ideal.</p>

<p>As the poet, standing by the sea-shore, ponders the
life that has been in the now empty shell washed up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
from the deep, his fancy discovers in the shell a resemblance
to human life and destiny, and he cries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the swift seasons roll!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave thy low-vaulted past!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let each new temple, nobler than the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou at length art free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is it possible that one could fall under the sway of
the poets and artists, appropriate their images and
fruitful style of thought, be wrought upon by their
fancies, and still remain dull and lifeless and prosaic
in the class-room? No wonder that true literature
has been called the literature of power, as distinguished
from the literature of knowledge (supplementary
readers, pure science, information books,
etc.). The lives and works of our best writers contain
an expansive spiritual energy, which, working
into the mind of a teacher, breaks the shell of
mechanism and formality. The artist gives bright
tints and colors to ideas which would otherwise be
faded and bleached.</p>

<p>The study of the best literature adapted to children
in each age is a fruitful form of psychology and
child study. The series of books selected for the
different grades is supposed to be adapted to the
children at each period. The books which suit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the temper and taste of children in primary grades
are peculiar in quality, and fit those pupils better
than older ones. In intermediate classes the boyhood
spirit, which delights in myth, physical deeds of
prowess, etc., shows itself, and many of the stories,
ballads, and longer poems breathe this spirit. In
grammar grades the expanding, maturing minds of
children leap forward to the appreciation of more
complex and extended forms of literature which deal
with some of the great problems of life more
seriously, as "Snow-Bound," "Evangeline," "Roger
de Coverley," "Merchant of Venice," etc.</p>

<p>Any poem or story which is suited to pupils of the
common school may generally be used in several
grades. Hawthorne's "Wonder Book," for instance,
may be used anywhere from the third to the eighth
grade by a skilful teacher. But for us the important
question is, to what age of children is it best
adapted? Where does its style of thought best fit
the temper of the children? The eighth grade may
read it and get pleasure and good from it, but it does
not come up to the full measure of their needs. Children
of the third grade cannot master it with sufficient
ease, but in the latter part of the fourth or first part
of the fifth grade it seems to exactly suit the wants,
that is, the spiritual wants, of the children. It will
vary, of course, in different schools and classes. Now,
it is a problem for our serious consideration to determine
what stories to use and just where each belongs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
within reasonable limits. Let us inquire where
the best culture effect can be realized from each
book used, where it is calculated to work its best
and strongest influence. To accomplish this result
it is necessary to study equally the temper of the
children and the quality of the books, to seek the
proper food for the growing mind at its different
stages. This is not chiefly a matter of simplicity or
complexity of language. Our readers are largely
graded by the difficulty of language. But literature
should be distributed through the school grades
according to its power to arouse thought and interest.
Language will have to be regarded, but as secondary.
Look first to the thought material which is to engage
children's minds, and then force the language into
subservice to that end. The final test to determine
the place of a selection in the school course must be
the experiment of the class-room. We may exercise
our best judgment beforehand, and later find that a
classic belongs one or two grades higher or lower
than we thought.</p>

<p>We really need some comprehensive principle upon
which to make the selection of materials as adapted
to the nature (psychology) of children. The theory
of the culture epochs of race history as parallel to
child development offers at least a suggestion. A
few of the great periods of history seem to correspond
fairly well to certain epochs of child growth. The
age of folk-lore and the fairy tale is often called the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
childhood of the race; the predominance of the
imagination and of the childlike interpretation of
things in nature reminds us strikingly of the fancies
of children. We find also that the literary remains
of this epoch in the world's history, the fairy tales,
are the peculiar delight of children from four to six.
In like manner the heroic age and its literary products
seem to fascinate the children of nine to eleven
years. In connection with this theory it is observed
that the greatest poets of the world in different
countries are those who have given poetic form and expression
to the typical ideas and characters of certain
epochs of history. So Homer, Virgil, Dante, Milton,
Scott. The best literature is, much of it, the precipitate
of the thought and life of historical epochs in
race development. Experiment has shown that
much of this literature is peculiarly adapted to exert
strong culture influence upon children. Emerson, in
his "Essay on History," says: "What is the foundation
of that interest all men feel in Greek history, letters,
art, and poetry, in all its periods, from the Heroic
or Homeric age down to the domestic life of the
Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later?
What but this, that every man passes personally
through a Grecian period?" And again: "The student
interprets the age of chivalry by his own age of
chivalry, and the days of maritime adventure and circumnavigation
by quite parallel miniature experiences
of his own. To the sacred history of the world, he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the same key. When the voice of a prophet out of the
deeps of antiquity merely echoes to him a sentiment of
his infancy, a prayer of his youth, he then pierces to the
truth through all the confusion of tradition and the
caricature of institutions." The literary heritage of
the chief culture epochs is destined therefore to enter
as a powerful agent in the education of children in
our schools, and the place of a piece of literature in
history suggests at least its place in child culture.</p>

<p>The study of these literary masterpieces, the choicest
of the world, while it offers a broad perspective
of history, also enters deep into the psychology of
children and their periods of growth and change.
What a study for the teacher!</p>

<p>Suppose now that a wise selection of the best
products for school use had been made. The books
for each grade would respond not only to the ability
but to the characteristic temper and mental status
of children at that age. The books would arouse
the full compass of the children's mental power,
their emotional as well as intellectual capacities,
their sympathy, interest, and feeling. The teacher
who is about to undertake the training of these
children may not know much about children of that
age. How can she best put herself into an attitude
by which she can meet and understand the children
on their own ground? Not simply their intellectual
ability and standing, but, better still, their impulses
and sympathies, their motives and hearts? Most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
people, as they reach maturity and advance in years,
have a tendency to grow away from their childhood.
Their purposes have changed from those of childhood
to those of mature life. They are no longer interested
in the things that interest children. Such things seem
trivial and even incomprehensible to them.</p>

<p>Now the person who is preparing to be a teacher
should grow back into his childhood. Without losing
the dignity or purpose of mature life, he should allow
the memories and sympathies of childhood to revive.
The insight which comes from companionship and
sympathy with children he needs in order to guide
them with tact and wisdom.</p>

<p>The literature which belongs to any age of childhood
is perhaps the best key to the spirit and disposition
of that period. The fact that it is of permanent
worth makes it a fit instrument with which the teacher
may reawaken the dormant experiences and memories
of that period in his own life. The teacher
who finds it impossible to reawaken his interest in the
literature that goes home to the hearts of children
has <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he is not qualified to
stimulate and guide their mental movements. The
human element in letters is the source of its deep
and lasting power; the human element in children
is the centre of their educative life, and he who disregards
this and thinks only of intellectual exercises
is a poor machine. The literature which children
appreciate and love is the key to their soul life. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
has power to stimulate teacher and pupil alike, and
is therefore a common ground where they may both
stand and look into each other's faces with sympathy.</p>

<p>This is not so much the statement of a theory as
a direct inference from many observations. It has
been observed repeatedly, in different schools under
many teachers, that the "Lady of the Lake," "Vision
of Sir Launfal," "Sleepy Hollow," or "Merchant of
Venice" have had an astonishing power to bring
teacher and children into near and cherished companionship.
It is not possible to express the profound
lessons of life that children get from the poets. In
the prelude to Whittier's "Among the Hills," what
a picture is drawn of the coarse, hard lot of parents
and children in an ungarnished home, "so pinched
and bare and comfortless," while the poem itself, a
view of that home among the hills which thrift and
taste and love have made,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Invites the eye to see and heart to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty and the joy within their reach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home and home loves and the beatitudes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature free to all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To study such poetry in its effect upon children is a
monopoly of the rich educational opportunity which
falls naturally into the hands of teachers. Psychology,
as derived from text-books, is apt to be cold
and formal; that which springs from the contact of
young minds with the fountains of song lives and
breathes. If a teacher desires to fit herself for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
primary instruction, she can do nothing so well calculated
to bring herself <i>en rapport</i> with little children
as to read the nursery rhymes, the fairy tales, fables,
and early myths. They bring her along a charming
road into the realm of childlike fancies and sympathies,
which were almost faded from her memory.
The same door is opened through well-selected
literature to the hearts of children in intermediate
and grammar grades.</p>

<p>The sense of humor is cultivated in literature
better than elsewhere. In fact, no other study
contains much material of humorous quality. A
quick sense of it is deemed by many of the best
judges an indispensable quality in teachers. Not
that a teacher needs to be a diverting story-teller
or entertainer, if only he has an indulgent patience
and kindly sympathy for those who enjoy telling
stories. There is a certain hearty, wholesome social
spirit in the enjoyment of humor which diffuses
itself like sunlight through a school. It contains an
element of kindliness, humanity, and good fellowship
which lubricates all the machinery and takes away
unnecessary stiffness and gravity in conduct. Best
of all it is a sort of mental balance-wheel for the
teacher, which enables him to see the ludicrous
phases of his own behavior, should he be inclined
to run to foolish extremes in various directions.
Much of our best literature abounds in humorous
elements. Lowell, Holmes, Shakespeare, and Irving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
are spontaneously rich in this quality of ore, and it
is just as well perhaps to cultivate our appreciation
in these richer veins as in shallow and unproductive
ones elsewhere.</p>

<p>Schlegel says of Shakespeare, his "comic talent
is equally wonderful with that he has shown in the
pathetic and tragic; it stands at an equal elevation
and possesses equal extent and profundity.... Not
only has he delineated many kinds of folly, but even
of sheer stupidity he has contrived to give a most
diverting and entertaining picture."</p>

<p>The inability to appreciate the ludicrous and farcical,
and especially of witty conceits, is felt to be a
mark of dulness and heaviness, and in dealing with
children and young people a versatile perception of
the humorous is very helpful. Many of the pupils
possess this quality of humor in a marked degree,
and the teacher should at least have sufficient insight
to appreciate this peculiar bent of mind and turn of
wit.</p>

<p>A brief retrospect will make plain the profitableness
of classics to the teacher. They show a deep
perspective into the spirit and inner workings of history.
The social life and insight developed by the
study of literature give tact and judgment to understand
and respect the many-sided individualities
found in every school. The teacher's own moral and
&aelig;sthetic and religious ideals are constantly lifted and
strengthened by the study of classics. Such reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
is a recreation and relief even in hours of weariness
and solitude. It is an expansive spiritual power
rather than a burden. Literary artists are also a
standing illustration of the graphic, spirited manner
of handling subjects. Finally, this rich and varied
realm of classic thought and expression is the doorway
by which we enter again into the moods and
impulses and fancies of childhood. We thus revive
our own youth and fit ourselves for a quick and appreciative
perception of children's needs. It is the
best kind of child study.</p>

<h3>LIST OF BOOKS</h3>


<p>The following list of books, arranged according to
grades, is designed to supply the children of the five
grades, from the fourth to the eighth inclusive, with
excellent reading matter in the form of complete
masterpieces of American and English literature.
It includes, besides the books for regular reading
lessons, a large list of collateral and closely related
works for the children and also for teachers.</p>

<p>The books of these lists contain a rich and varied
fund of finest culture material, first of all for the
teacher, and, through her spirit and enthusiasm, for
the children.</p>

<p>Besides the general discussions of these books in
the preceding chapters, a few additional explanations
are necessary to make plain the grounds upon which
this particular selection and arrangement of books is
based. The whole purpose of the preceding chapters
is to throw light upon this list, and to qualify the
teacher for an intelligent and efficient use of these
books as school readers.</p>

<p>1. The books apportioned to each grade or year
are divided into three series. The first series is care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>fully
selected to serve as regular reading-books for
that grade. Almost without exception they are complete
works, or collections of complete poems, stories,
etc. Many of them are very familiar and have been
much used in the schools. The number of books for
each grade is large, so as to have room for choice
and adaptation to each class.</p>

<p>The second series consists of closely related collateral
readings derived from a much wider range of
books in literature, history, and science. Many of
these books of the second list are not so strictly masterpieces
of literature, but of a secondary rank as
prose renderings of the great poems, myths, and
stories of other languages, also American and European
history stories. These materials are well adapted
for the reference studies and home readings of children.
They all deal with interesting and worthy
subjects of thought in a superior style. Many of
these books, however, are great and permanent works
of literature. They are materials, also, which the
teacher should be familiar with. They should be
constantly referred to and discussed in connection
with the first series. It is quite probable that some
teachers will prefer books of the second series for
regular reading in the place of some suggested in
the first series.</p>

<p>The third series consists of books for teachers, including
great works of literature, history, and science,
which will enrich the teacher's knowledge and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>tribute
to a broader enthusiasm and culture. The
writings of some of the great essayists, as Ruskin,
Carlyle, Emerson, Kingsley, Motley, Lowell, Huxley,
Macaulay, and others, are peculiarly fit to broaden
the teacher's horizon and ennoble his purpose. Some
of the best poems and novels suitable for advanced
study are mentioned. There are also books which
deal in a comprehensive and critical, but sympathetic,
way with important literary topics, as the myths and
great epics, the age of chivalry, and the lives of the
most eminent writers. Some of the best works of
biography and history are also suggested for teachers,
and a number of the best professional and pedagogical
books for teachers, dealing with literature, reading,
and child study.</p>

<p>2. This list of books is of course tentative. There
are other literary works as good, perhaps, but not a
few difficulties stand in the way of the best selection.
A few of the best materials are scattered in books
not available for school purposes. Some of the finest
of our longer classics have not been tested much in
school use. There is, however, an abundance of
choice English works, complete, well printed and
bound, in cheap, schoolbook form. The chief difficulty,
after all, is in selecting and arranging the best
of an abundant and varied collection of excellent literature.
This inspiring problem lies but partly solved
at the threshold of every teacher's work. It requires
extensive knowledge of literature and experience in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
its use in classes. A masterpiece may be read in
several grades, and teachers will differ in judging
its true place. Schools and classes differ also in
their capacity and previous preparation for classic
readings, so that no course of reading will fit all
schools, or, perhaps, any two schools. Many principals
will prefer to use the books one or two grades
lower, or higher, than here indicated. Every teacher
should use such a list according to his best individual
judgment as based upon the needs of his school.
This list was discussed and partly made out in conference
with a number of experienced superintendents,
and much variety of opinion was expressed as
to the best grade for the use of a number of the
selections.</p>

<p>3. The books chosen for each grade are designed
to be a suitable combination of prose and poetry, of
short and long selections from history, science, and
letters. Variety in subject-matter and style is required
in each grade, although certain strong individual
characteristics are expected to appear in the literature
of each year's work. Many of the shorter poems
fit in well with longer masterpieces in prose and
verse. Some of the epics, myths, and historical episodes
are told in both prose and verse. The children
may well meet and study them in both forms.
If from four to six larger masterpieces could be read
each year, and these could bring out the style and
quality of so many authors, if a number of suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
shorter pieces could be read and related to the former,
the many-sided influence of literature would
prove each year effective. Literature is the broadest
of all subjects, both as a basis of culture and for the
unification of the varied studies. It touches every
phase of experience and knowledge along its higher
levels, and overlooks the whole field of life from the
standpoint of the seer and poet. The classic readings
should aim at the completeness, variety, and
elevation of thought which literature alone can give.
Every year's literature should open the gates to
meadow and woodland, to park and fruitful fields,
into rich and shaded valleys, and up to free and
sunny hilltops and mountains.</p>

<p>4. The list of books for each year includes two or
three books of miscellaneous collections of classics in
prose and verse. Many of the selections are short and
some fragmentary. Such are the three volumes of
"Open Sesame," the "Golden Treasury of Songs and
Lyrics," "Children's Treasury of English Song," and
"Book of Golden Deeds." In each of the books named
is found a variety of material suited perhaps to two
or three grades. In most of the books just named it
is not intended in our plan that all the selections
should be read through in succession. It will be
better for the teacher to select from those collections
such choice poems, stories, etc., as will enrich and
supplement the longer classics, and give that added
variety so needful. Many of the finest poems in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
our language are short, and should not be omitted
from our school course. They should be read and
some of them memorized by the children. It would
be well if the teacher had in each grade one or two
sets of such books of choice miscellaneous materials
from which to select occasional reading. The regular
readers used by the children would consist of the
longer masterpieces, which would be supplemented
by the shorter selections. In this way greater unity
and variety might be achieved within the limits of
each grade.</p>

<p>5. Information books and supplementary readers
in history, geography, and natural science have been
excluded, in the main, from our lists. The test of
literary excellence has been applied to most of the
books chosen. De Quincey's distinction between the
literature of knowledge and that of power is our line
of demarkation. It seems to us probable that the
future will call for a still more stringent adherence to
this principle of selection. Information readers are
good and necessary in their place in geography,
history, and natural science; but they are not good
enough to take the place of classics in reading lessons.
The only exceptions to the rule of classics are the
prose renderings of the old classics, as the "Story of
the Odyssey," and the biographical stories from history.
Both these have so much of interest and stimulus
for the young that they seem to harmonize with our
plan. But criticism may yet expose their inadequacy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>It is our plan, in brief, to limit the reading work
mainly to the choice masterpieces of the best authors,
and to render these studies as fruitful as possible in
spiritual power. If supplementary readings are used
at all, let them be those which will strengthen the
influence of the classics.</p>

<p>It has been our plan to collect in the Special
Method Books devoted to geography, history, and
natural science, a full list of the supplementary
readers and information books in those subjects.</p>

<p>6. In our list, however, is included quite a number
of classic renderings of science and nature topics.
Such are "Wake Robin," "Birds and Bees," "A
Hunting of the Deer," etc., "Sharp Eyes" etc.,
"Succession of Forest Trees," "Up and Down the
Brooks," "Water Babies," "The Foot-path Way,"
"Madam How and Lady Why," "Wilderness Ways,"
"In Bird Land," and many others.</p>

<p>These books, however, belong to the literature of
power. They look at nature through the eyes of
poet and artist and enthusiast. They are not cold,
matter-of-fact delineations. They unfold the &aelig;sthetic
and human side of nature, the divinity of flower and
tree. These books are the communings of the soul
with nature, and are closely related in spirit to the
poems of nature in Bryant, Wordsworth, Tennyson,
and other poets. There has been a chasm between
them and our text-books in science which needs
bridging over. Now that science is beginning to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
taught objectively, experimentally, and inductively,
there will be much less of a hiatus at this stage, because
there is so much that is powerfully stimulating
in nature study.</p>

<p>7. Some books are named twice in the lists, first as
books of reference, or in the teacher's lists, and in a
later grade for the use of children in regular reading.
We have been especially careful in selecting appropriate
books in the first list for each grade adapted
to the age of the children. These books for regular
reading must be used by every child, so that they
should be fitted to the average ability. The reference
books for collateral reading in the second series of
each grade may be more difficult in some cases, as
they will be used, in part, only by the stronger pupils.</p>

<p>There are certain groups of kindred books, like the
Greek myths, that are distributed through three or
more grades. It is not expected that any child will
use all of these books, as several of them may deal
with the same story, like the "Iliad" or "Odyssey."
It seemed best to include all the important renderings
of these stories, and leave the teacher to choose
among them for his class.</p>

<p>8. To give more specific aid to teachers, most of
the books are briefly described, and some notion of
their special worth and fitness indicated. It is hoped
that these short descriptions will be of considerable
help to young teachers in making selections for their
classes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Many of the best and most commonly used
books are published by several companies. In such
cases the names of the different publishers are indicated
in connection with each book.</p>

<p>10. By an examination of these lists the teacher of
any grade will discover that, in order to teach well,
she must be acquainted with the books used in one
or two grades, both above and below her own. All
the chief groups of books in literature run through
three or four grades, and the teacher in any grade
needs to get a comprehensive view of the important
groups of books used in her classes. In addition to
this, the books recommended for teachers give a still
more definite and comprehensive grasp of large
classes of literary material. The books recommended
for teachers could be indefinitely extended, but it is
hoped that enough are mentioned to give definiteness
to their wider studies, and to serve as an introduction
to some of the larger fields of literature, science, and
history.</p>

<p>11. There are certain peculiar difficulties connected
with the reading of longer classics which are much
less frequently met with in the usual school readers.
These difficulties are of such a real and serious kind
that many teachers are apt to be discouraged before
success is attained. Complete classics like Webster's
speeches, "Julius C&aelig;sar," "Snow-Bound," "Marmion,"
and "Evangeline" have been regarded as
too long and difficult for school purposes. We have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
found, however, that the greater length, if rightly
utilized, only intensifies the effect of a masterpiece.
The chief objection is the greater language difficulty
(hard and unusual words, proper names, etc.) of the
longer classics. This is a real obstacle and must be
fairly met. It is impossible to grade down the language
and thought of a great writer. It is necessary to bring
the class up to his level rather than bring him down
to theirs. This requires time and skill and perseverance
on the teacher's part, and labor and thought in
the children. It may require a week or a month to
get a class well under way in "Lady of the Lake,"
"King of the Golden River," or the "Sketch-Book."
But when well done it is a conquest of no mean
importance. The language, style, and characteristics
of the author are strange and difficult. The scales
must drop from children's eyes before they will
appreciate Ruskin or Tennyson or Emerson. The
wings of fancy, the &aelig;sthetic sense, do not unfold in
a single day. But if these initial difficulties can be
overcome, we shall emerge soon into the sunlight of
interest and success. It takes a degree of faith in
good things and patience under difficulties to attain
success in classic readings. Even when the teacher
thinks he is doing fairly well, the parents sometimes
say the work is too hard and the verbal difficulties
too great. Generally, however, parents are satisfied
when children work hard and are interested.</p>

<p>Again, children whose reading in the lower grades<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
has been of the information order lack the imaginative
power that is essential to the grasp and enjoyment
of any masterpiece. The sleeping or dulled
fancy must be awakened. The power to image
things, so natural to the poet, must be aroused and
exercised. The lack of training in vivid and poetic
thought in early years is sure to make itself felt in
deficient and languid thought and feeling in the
higher grades. But we cannot afford to give up
the struggle. We may be forced to begin lower
down in the series of books, but anything less than
a classic is not fit for the children.</p>

<p>12. The leading publishing houses are now competing
vigorously in bringing out the best complete
classics in cheap, durable, well-printed form for
school use. In our list the names of the publishers
are given. Most of the companies can be addressed
in Boston, Chicago, New York, or San Francisco.
Most of the books bound in boards or cloth range
in price from twenty-five to fifty cents. The pamphlet
editions are from ten to fifteen cents. The
larger books of miscellaneous collections and some
of the science classics range from seventy-five cents
to a dollar and a quarter. A few of the books are
priced as high as two dollars.</p>

<p>13. Before final publication, the following lists of
books have been submitted to the criticism of a number
of able superintendents and to the leading publishing
houses. In consequence considerable changes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and additions have been made. The chief criticism
offered was that the books, in a number of cases, are
too difficult for the grades indicated. To meet this
objection a few changes were made, while in several
cases books are described as suitable for two or three
grades.</p>

<p>For the sake of quick and easy reference in finding
any book, an alphabetical list of the titles of all
the books is given at the close, and the page indicated
where each book may be found in the descriptive
list.</p>

<p>"I have been teaching the subject in the Boston Normal School
for over twenty years, and Book I is the book I have been looking
for for the last ten years. It comes nearer to what I have been
working for than anything in the geography line that I have yet
seen. I congratulate you on the good work."</p>

<p>"I am much pleased with it and have had enthusiastic praise
for it from all the teachers to whom I have shown it. It seems to
me to be scientific, artistic, and convenient to a marked degree.
The maps are a perfect joy to any teacher who has been using
the complicated affairs given in most books of the kind."</p>

<p>"I have just finished examining the first book of Tarr and
McMurry's Geographies. I have read the book with care from
cover to cover. To say that I am pleased with it is expressing
it mildly. It seems to me just what a geography should be. It is
correctly conceived and admirably executed. The subject is approached
from the right direction and is developed in the right
proportions. And those maps&mdash;how could they be any better?
Surely authors and publishers have achieved a triumph in text-book
making. I shall watch with interest for the appearance of
the other two volumes."</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
